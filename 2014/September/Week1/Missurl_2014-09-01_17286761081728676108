Because of P2P, data transfer is safely checked, and the hashes ensure that data isn\u2019t modified. This is used every time you send money through bitcoin wallets to \ntransfer\n the money. Bitcoin for example has proven the model for years with its safe, decentralized, transfer methods. It\u2019s clear that blockchain has the ability to lay the foundation for a new era of safe commerce, but where else can it go?\u00a0 Identity theft is an area where centralized locations can hurt a lot. If one location is compromised, millions of records including client data being compromised.\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, in 2014, Sony was hacked and employee information was sent out causing all sorts of damage. Personal conversations, salaries, and executive info were released. This is clearly theft of information.\u00a0 Another incident of company hacking that hurt identity theft was in 2019. Capital One was hacked and 100 million records were stolen, according to CMBC. Over the last decade, many companies have been hacked and because they store vast amounts of data; hundreds of millions of records were stolen. The list will go on and on if these company databases are not decentralized.\u00a0\n\n\nIdentity theft is easiest through centralized locations that store lots of data. If the data is decentralized through blockchain, access to large amounts of data disappears. Blockchain acts as a network for data transfer for bitcoin, so it should effectively work as a secure data hub. When data is accessed, transfers will be made, and forced access would be denied by P2P The whole system would have to agree on storage and retrieval.\u00a0 Using a complex system to access information could effectively \nprevent\n unwarranted access to data.\u00a0 It\u2019s unlikely that all cyber-attacks will ever end, so the best that can be done is mitigation.\u00a0\n\n\nLots of personal information is kept on business and government systems, and by spreading out the potential targets, the chance that anyone is hit is lessened. Even if part of the system is hit, most of the data won\u2019t be compromised if blockchain is used. If the order of blocks for transfers is done by proxy, the hacked hash order won\u2019t match the initial order by which the blocks were made. The hashes won\u2019t match. If a hash is recalculated with access, it could work. This is another potential layer for blockchain to step into with identity protection. Because blockchain is so simple and moldable, it has the capability to secure any system. Blockchain is like culling a forest to prevent forest fires.\u00a0 Because the trees aren\u2019t dense in a central location, the fire can\u2019t spread easily. When it comes to identity theft, the problem is mitigated when someone is hit and only a small fire lights.\u00a0 Because thieves cannot be in the same location as us, using proxy as identity in a blockchain adds an extra layer of security.\u00a0\n\n\nP2P transfer allows for a location to be certified without knowing exactly where a computer is, which is critical for solving this problem. If I knew where you were, I could copy your location. The check for location is the order of blocks in proximity to you (including you).\u00a0 According to the III, Identity theft is a global problem, affecting roughly 15 million people a year. If central locations for information are taken apart, then there will be less information to steal. Because names have credibility attached to them, they are something to covet.\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain is a global giant in the commerce world, but information is a sort of commerce as well. Centralized information is dangerous because it acts as a target for theft. Blockchain solved this with P2p and spreads the information out with checks. Another reason identity theft can be solved by blockchain is through the ability to use blocks chained by proxy. This potential makes identity theft unable to be done from afar.\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain is an effective method for safe information transfer and storage, by mitigating the amount of data that can be attacked. In the future, blockchain has the ability to become a new system for the modern world of information storage and transfer. If you want to learn more about it, \ncheck\n blockchain consulting companies to do that. For now, the cloud is a large datacenter owned by google or amazon, but eventually, it could be people\u2019s data protecting each other through blockchain. Data is the most valuable thing in the modern world and figuring out how to protect it is essential.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
