Following ETH\u2019s restricted movement observed over the past few days, these colossal ETH transfers unveiled by PeckShieldAlert promptly nabbed significant investor attention, birthing speculations over the transfers potentially being one of reasons for ETH\u2019s weekly dip.\n\n\n\n\nHECOBridge is an on-chain bridge that facilitates the transfer of funds between the Ethereum network and Heco Chain, HTX\u2019s blockchain. Following its exploitation as of late November 2023, a significant loss of funds was reported, evaluating nearly $86 million.\n\n\nA Closer Look Into The Report\n\n\nAccording to the insights offered by PeckShield Alert, the exploiter moved 40,391.8 ETH in the past eight days, collectively shifting them to Tornado Cash, a decentralized cryptocurrency tumbler. This massive dump to the decentralized platform sparked concerns over ETH\u2019s bearish movement over the past week.\n\n\nValued at approximately $145 million, the abovementioned amount of ETH was shifted in eighteen separate transactions over the past eight days. Whereas, the ETH price also dipped remarkably at the same time, illustrating a 5.94% fall in the past seven days. This sparked concerns orbiting the above-mentioned colossal ETH dumps and its potential aid in pulling ETH\u2019s price back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the transfers PeckShieldAlert revealed backed up ETH\u2019s recent dip, showcasing supply gains for the token on exchanges, even decentralized. Simultaneously, market dynamics for \nEthereum\n stirred a whirlpool of speculations among crypto market enthusiasts globally, hinting at bears taking control in the market.\n\n\nAlso Read: \nReddit IPO Price Soars, Here\u2019s Why?\n\n\nEthereum Price Slips\n\n\nAs of writing, the \nEthereum token\u2019s price\n noted a 2.99% drop over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,431.55. With the token\u2019s market cap and 24-hour trading volume showcasing a plunge of 2.94% and 38.26%, ETH painted a bearish climate for itself today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, with the significant dump by HECOBridge exploiters further weighing in, additional bearish market sentiments on ETH persist. \nCoinglass\n spotlighted a considerable dip in the token\u2019s open interest and volume, per derivatives data, adding to the this bearishness.\n\n\nAlso Read: \nBybit App Disappears From Apple App Store In India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       \nCoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
