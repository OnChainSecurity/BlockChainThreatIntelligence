Sun has an interest in both HECO bridge and HTX.\n\n\nLast year, he integrated TRON and BitTorrent ecosystem with HECO Bridge with similar integrations on Houbi which rebranded as HTX this year to mark its tenth anniversary.\n\nHTX suspends deposits\n\nSun confirmed the incident on X (Twitter) saying both platforms had witnessed a malicious attack but the company would fully compensate for all losses and has temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals.\n\n\"All Funds in HTX Are Secure, and the Community Can Rest Assured. We are investigating the specific reasons for the hacker attack. Once we complete the investigation and identify the cause, we will resume services.\" \n\nAnother blockchain security firm, PeckShield has reported losses from ETH initially and subsequently USDC, Chainlink (LINK), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) sent to other wallets.\n\n\nThis development has sparked an uproar among the community on social media spaces with many calling it a trend while others blaming the huge white hat bounties offered to bad actors.\n\nX user Orbitalflux joked about the company\u2019s lack of \"anti-virus\" while YazanXBT lamented on the recent crisis, \"What\u2019s going on? First HTX, then Poloniex, and now the Bridge. You\u2019re being really unfortunate lately.\"\n\nA series of unfortunate events\n\nDigital asset exchange, Poloniex acquired by Sun suffered a hack that led to over $100 million worth of assets being drained. The company has opened an investigation into the incident and says it uncovered the hacker\u2019s identity offering an increased white hat bounty of $10 million before it starts full criminal investigations.\n\nRecall that HTX was hacked and drained of 500 ETH approximately $8 million at the time with the company stating that everything was under control and funds were safe. Particularly, Sun, the company\u2019s advisor noted that the company was in a good financial position to cover all losses."
