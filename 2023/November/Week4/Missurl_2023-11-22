Previously, CTO of Paus, a Web3 platform acquired by CINDIE.Web3, the next generation of the internet, has gained significant momentum in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize web interactions, give users more control over their data and privacy, and enable new forms of peer-to-peer collaboration.\n\nHowever, just like any emerging technology, Web3 raises a range of questions related to its potential robustness and efficiency. A recent survey by Coinbase Institute demonstrates many early Web3 adopters agree there are certain levels of ambiguity around the technology.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll review some of the major concerns as a result of this ambiguity and estimate if the potential of Web3 justifies the risks of being an early adopter.\n\n1. Stability Risks\nThe fact remains that no technology is risk-free from failing. Web3 is not immune to stability risks either, especially given its early stage, complex nature and open-source model.\n\nOne of the most famous decentralized networks, Solana, has already experienced seven network outages since its onset in 2020. Nonetheless, the system was put back on track every time, and the network itself hasn\u2019t been compromised.\n\nLesson learned: Solana and other Web3 providers learn from mistakes to strengthen their systems and minimize further stability risks.\n\nHere are potential ways stability issues can be resolved in the future:\n\nDeveloped standards for Web3 apps and protocols aimed at improving the system\u2019s compatibility and security.\nStrengthened system\u2019s resilience thanks to an expanded scale of the networks, which is much more difficult to attack due to no single point of failure.\nHigher system resilience thanks to more investments in R&D efforts, making Web3 technology more widespread and advanced.2. Potential Security Issues\nWeb3\u2019s decentralized infrastructure makes cyberattacks more likely to cascade across the entire network rather than affecting a single node as in traditional web attacks.\n\nYet with respect to Web3 security measures, there is no denying that the Web3 community has robust defense mechanisms in place to leverage powerful data protection strategies.\n\nSome of these potential data protection methods include:\n\nCryptographic algorithms for encryption, including asymmetric encryption, homomorphic encryption and other advanced practices.\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for the extra layers of security in terms of data authentication, verification and disclosures.\nDifferential privacy, a technique that involves obfuscating data to protect user privacy while still allowing for useful insights to be extracted.\n3. The Efficiency Of The Output System\nThe field of data providers for decentralized apps is currently limited, with most dApps relying on a few major players. It might be an obstacle to making fair judgments on specific aspects of data, such as data biases, relevance and accuracy. Besides, the lack of standardized output practices makes it hard to compare data from different providers.\n\nHowever, considering the early stage of Web3, more alternatives will undoubtedly emerge in the future to address this market gap.\n\nHere\u2019s how Web3 adopters can currently tackle this issue:\n\nStaying actively involved in the Web3 community by engaging in discussions and looking up best practices in dApp forums, Discord channels or other resources.\nBenchmarking a range of currently existing tools and comparing output systems of different dApps.\nContributing to the development of new output systems by providing feedback to dApps developers, reporting bugs and contributing code.\n4. Untapped Legal Aspects\nData privacy and protection, virtual governance, regulatory compliance on a state level and infringement prevention are the aspects that still need to be covered to leverage compliance across Web3.\n\nSome steps have already been taken in this matter. For example, asset management giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest, recently filed for Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs to impose tracking of the investment results of blockchain and crypto-related activities. The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission is investigating blockchain- and NFT-related activities to develop reporting rules for exchanges. And Australia and Canada are setting taxation policies for Bitcoin as a financial asset. Such actions will definitely be gaining momentum in the future.\n\nHere are a few points to be considered:\n\nThe Web3 ecosystem can soon be more reliant on legislation procedures and practices.\nWeb3 users need to regularly monitor the updates and news related to new legislation rules in order to comply with them accordingly.\n5. Change Management Concerns\nThe decentralized nature of the systems and their community-based structure make them less flexible.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the more successful a distributed protocol is, the harder it is to alter or expand-all due to the number of nodes that will have to adopt these changes. Besides, the more stakeholders take part in the decision-making process, the longer it takes to agree on it and implement it accordingly.\n\nHere are some steps that can be done to tackle this aspect:\n\nConsensus protocols should be created to make change management in Web3 more standardized.\nBringing in extra extensions, plug-ins, patch versions or any other new solutions might make the system better adaptable to changes.\n6. The Lack Of Tech Expertise For A Large-Scale Adoption\nA full transition to the full-scale application of Web3 won\u2019t be possible without more people developing and using dApps. Going through heaps of complicated code will require time, skill, and sufficient motivation-all of which can become serious factors against opting for Web3 and thus limiting its pool of users.\n\nHere are a few potential ways this concern can be resolved:\n\nSociety will become more tech-savvy in the future, with the vast majority having basic coding knowledge.\nThe entire concept of Web3 will be reshaped toward becoming more accessible for less tech-savvy people.\nA hybrid form of the internet that bridges the gap between centralized and decentralized networks will emerge, expanding its reach to a wider range of users.\nFinal Notes\nThe list of above-mentioned Web3 concerns is not exhaustive and may also include the unpredictability of cryptocurrency rates, the risk of centralization and others.\n\nDespite these concerns, the idea behind Web3 has the potential to revolutionize the digital world by giving users greater control over their data, unprecedented freedom in managing their content, and new ways to own digital assets.\n\nBy applying Web3 best practices, staying active in the community, and regularly monitoring the latest industry updates, early adopters can maximize the benefits of Web3 for their businesses.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.
