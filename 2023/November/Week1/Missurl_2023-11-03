Interestingly, blockchain technology, which serves as a core component of web3, can serve inherent security benefits for web3.\n\nThe distributed ledger technology has provided an ideal platform for developing the web3 landscape. Starting from smart contracts to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, web3 is incomplete without decentralized technology. You could wonder about the role of blockchain in web3 security and its benefits, as the web3 landscape has encountered formidable setbacks in terms of security. Let us find out how blockchain could empower web3 security.Evolution of the Web\nThe best way to start exploring the relationship between blockchain and web3 security is to navigate the evolution of the web. The internet, web or World Wide Web, has been through multiple changes, and web3 is the third generation of internet. You can identify the importance of blockchain in web3 by identifying the limitations associated with previous iterations of the internet.\n\nThe first stage of the Internet, or Web 1.0, was created solely for read-only use cases and directories. The primary goal of Web 1.0 was information sharing, and there were a limited number of content creators. Web 1.0 largely included static pages, and most of the internet users were content consumers.\n\nWeb 2.0 changed the script and transformed internet users into content creators. The second version of the internet might have been responsible for initiating some of the popular web3 security threats, such as phishing and theft of sensitive information. Web 2.0 gained popularity for its design as a read-and-write web with the facility of social interactions.\n\nAdvancements in Web 2.0 also led to the rise of different web development frameworks, platforms, and programming languages. Web 2.0 enabled every network to have its own data, which enabled personalized interactions with users. It also provided the flexibility for dynamic content accessibility. \n\nThe biggest problem with Web 2.0 was the monopoly of tech giants and intervention of centralized authorities in web services. For example, you would have to create an account on a platform for using its services. Creating the account would require users to reveal their personal and sensitive information. \n\nWeb 3.0 changed the equation by introducing blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that enabled decentralization of the Internet. Apart from distributed ledger technology, web3 also leverages many other technologies, such as AI and IoT, to provide personalized web experiences to users. In addition, it also ensures that users have complete control over their data and online experiences. \n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains\u2019 Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Help Web3?\nBefore you seek answers to \"What is the role of blockchain?\" in security of web3 solutions, it is important to understand the technology\u2019s functionalities in web3. Distributed ledger technology helps in improving the internet. You can notice the growing trend of adoption of enterprise blockchain solutions, which redefine the systems and approaches for storing and managing data on the internet. The effective use of decentralization could help in conducting transactions without the involvement of third-party services such as Google, Amazon, or banks. Imagine conducting online transactions such as purchasing products or taking loans without the involvement of banks.\n\nThe primary advantages of distributed ledger technology include decentralization, transparency, security, and immutability. With a peer-to-peer network, consumers could find better transparency as anyone could check and validate data from blocks. It provides a trustless environment without any centralized intervention, which also leads to security vulnerabilities. Who would you complain to if you lose your assets in web3? The concerns regarding accountability in a trustless environment pose a major security threat for web3. \n\nIn addition, blockchain also provides the advantage of transparency, which again turns back as a disadvantage. For example, smart contracts on public blockchains are visible to everyone on the network. Malicious actors could exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contract code to compromise sensitive information or steal the assets of users.\n\nLearn the fundamentals, challenges and use cases of Web3.0 blockchain from Web 3.0 Blockchain E-book\n\nImportance of Blockchain Security \nWeb3 is susceptible to new types of attacks, including the existing array of exploits. However, you can find a clear impression of the role of blockchain in web3 security by learning about blockchain security. The ledger technology offers inherent security traits. It has been designed on the foundations of cryptography, consensus, and decentralization, which ensure security of transactions.\n\nMost of the blockchains have the data in blocks, where each block contains a collection of multiple transactions. Every new block could connect to all the previous blocks in an immutable manner. In addition, every transaction in the blocks goes through validation through a consensus mechanism in which all network participants agree to the truth and correctness of a transaction. \n\nOn top of it, blockchain also facilitates another security advantage with decentralization. It ensures freedom from the concerns of a single point of failure, which is a security concern in centralized systems. At the same time, it is also important to note that blockchain technologies also have differences in certain crucial security aspects.Difference in Security between Different Blockchain Variants\nBlockchain networks could differ from each other in terms of access privileges to data. The relationship between blockchain and web3 security depends on the variations in types of networks. The different categories of networks include public, private, permissioned, and permissionless. Public or private networks are differentiated on the basis of permissions for participation. On the other hand, permissioned and permissionless networks are differentiated on the grounds of methods used for accessing the network.\n\nPublic blockchains could allow any individual to join the network, and they could remain anonymous. Private blockchains rely on identity mechanisms for confirming membership and access privileges and allow only known organizations to participate in the network. The permissionless networks do not impose any restrictions on validators or the individuals who would process transactions on the network. Permissioned blockchains feature a limited set of validators with verified identities.\n\nCurious to develop an in-depth understanding of web3 application architecture?
