        "original_content": "Sam Bankman-Fried\n, the tousle-haired mogul who founded the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, was convicted on Thursday of seven charges of fraud and conspiracy after a monthlong trial that laid bare the rampant hubris and risk-taking across the crypto industry.\nMr. Bankman-Fried became a symbol of crypto\u2019s excesses last year \nwhen FTX collapsed\n and he was charged with stealing as much as $10 billion from customers to finance political contributions, venture capital investments and other extravagant spending. A jury of nine women and three men took just over four hours of deliberation on Thursday to reach a verdict, convicting Mr. Bankman-Fried of wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering.\nTogether the counts carry a maximum sentence of 110 years. Mr. Bankman-Fried, 31, is expected to appeal. He\u2019s scheduled to be sentenced on March 28.\nSubscribe to The Times\n to read as many articles as you like."
