This will be the first major \nEthereum\n marketplace contractually obligated to honor creator royalties. This effort reinforces Yuga Labs' and Magic Eden's commitment to protecting creator royalties and innovating on a model where more builders come to the space.\n\n\nYuga Labs and Magic Eden share a unified vision for the future of web3, emphasizing the importance of creating a fair and rewarding ecosystem for imaginative content contributors. This collaboration, built on the \nEthereum\n blockchain, is an extension of this commitment. It hinges not only on the principle of ownership but on empowering creators to continue receiving royalty payments for their original work.\n\n\nYuga Labs and Magic Eden have made it unequivocal that respecting creator royalties is non-negotiable, a clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs. Going forward, for new collections, Yuga Labs will exclusively engage with marketplaces that uphold these principles, ensuring fair treatment of creators.\n\n\n\"We see this partnership with Magic Eden as a win for the whole ecosystem,\" said Yuga Labs CEO \nDaniel Alegre\n. \"We appreciate everyone in the space taking steps in this direction, and invite like-minded participants to get on board. Magic Eden is putting their money where their mouth is, and together we are supporting the building of an \nEthereum\n marketplace that will back creators, without whom web3 would not exist.\"\n\n\nThis announcement is part of Yuga Labs' ongoing commitment to solve some of the most fundamental issues that creators and builders face today as the company keeps its eye on its mission of building culture on the blockchain. On the Magic Eden marketplace, all creators can add their collections to an ever-evolving landscape, and bring along others to participate in a fairer, more equitable ecosystem.\n\n\n\"We remain committed to the betterment of the web3 creator ecosystem, steadfast in our belief that we should champion creators who are the heart and soul of the industry,\" added Magic Eden CEO and co-founder, \nJack Lu\n. \"Right now, it's a priority to provide creatives with the support they deserve with creator royalty programs. In collaboration with Yuga Labs, we're set to a develop an \nEthereum\n marketplace that resets the standard for royalty allocation and are hopeful this action will reverberate throughout the ecosystem.\"\n\n\nAbout Yuga Labs\nYuga Labs is a web3 company shaping the future through storytelling, experiences, and community.
