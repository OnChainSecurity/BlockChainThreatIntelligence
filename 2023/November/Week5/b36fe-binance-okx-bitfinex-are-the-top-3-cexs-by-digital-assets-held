This has led to the theft of around $60 million in crypto from almost 100,000 accounts in six months.\n\nFlorence Finance is an Arbitrum-based real-world asset DeFi lending protocol that enables users to borrow digital assets against their real-world collateral.\n\nAccording to the documentation, it uses stablecoin commitments to fund loans to real-world businesses and distributes the real-world yield back to the stablecoin funders.\n\nBig Month for DeFi Exploits\nNovember has been a busy month for DeFi and crypto hackers. On Nov. 30, PeckShield also reported that the Uranium Finance attacker was moving funds.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert #UraniumFinance exploiter-labeled address has transferred 800 $ETH (~$1.6M) to #tornadocash pic.twitter.com/XkqYV83YwX\n\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) November 30, 2023\n\nAccording to the De.Fi Yield Rekt Database, millions in crypto assets have been lost this month to hacks and exploits.\n\nThese include KyberSwap losing $45 million in a flash loan attack on Nov. 23 and HTX losing $21 million in an access control exploit on Nov. 22.\n\nFurthermore, Heco Bridge was exploited for $86 million this month, and Onyx Protocol lost $2 million in a flash loan attack.\n\nThe post RWA Protocol Florence Finance Loses $1.45M in Address Poisoning Attack appeared first on CryptoPotato."
