        "original_content": "SEC Charges Kraken for Operating as an Unregistered Securities Exchange, Broker, Dealer, and Clearing Agency\nFor Immediate Release\n\n2023-237\nWashington D.C., Nov. 20, 2023 -\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Payward Inc. and Payward Ventures Inc., together known as Kraken, with operating Kraken\u2019s crypto trading platform as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, since at least September 2018, Kraken has made hundreds of millions of dollars unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities. The SEC alleges that Kraken intertwines the traditional services of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without having registered any of those functions with the Commission as required by law. Kraken\u2019s alleged failure to register these functions has deprived investors of significant protections, including inspection by the SEC, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest, among others.\n\nThrough its platform\u2019s services, Kraken allegedly:\n\nProvides a marketplace that brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established, non-discretionary methods under which such orders interact, and thus operates as an exchange;\nEngages in the business of effecting securities transactions for the accounts of Kraken customers, and thus operates as a broker;\nEngages in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account without an applicable exception, and thus operates as a dealer; and\nServes as an intermediary in settling transactions in crypto asset securities by Kraken customers, and acts as a securities depository, and thus operates as a clearing agency.\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that Kraken\u2019s business practices, deficient internal controls, and poor recordkeeping practices present a range of risks for its customers. As alleged in the complaint, Kraken commingles its customers\u2019 money with its own, including paying operational expenses directly from accounts that hold customer cash. Kraken also allegedly commingles its customers\u2019 crypto assets with its own, creating what its own auditor had identified as \"a significant risk of loss\" to its customers.\n\n\"We allege that Kraken made a business decision to reap hundreds of millions of dollars from investors rather than coming into compliance with the securities laws. That decision resulted in a business model rife with conflicts of interest that placed investors\u2019 funds at risk,\" said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \"Kraken\u2019s choice of unlawful profits over investor protection is one we see far too often in this space, and today we\u2019re both holding Kraken accountable for its misconduct and sending a message to others to come into compliance.\"\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Kraken violated the registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeks injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and penalties.\n\nIn February of this year, Kraken agreed to cease offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs and pay a civil penalty of $30 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Elizabeth Goody and Jennie B. Krasner of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Peter Moores of the Boston Regional Office with the assistance of Sachin Verma and Pasha Salimi. It was supervised by Paul Kim, Jorge Tenreiro, and David Hirsch of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The SEC\u2019s litigation will be led by Alec Johnson, Daniel Blau, and Mr. Moores under the supervision of Douglas Miller, Olivia Choe, and Mr. Tenreiro.\n\n###\n\nLast Reviewed or Updated: Nov. 21, 2023"
