        "original_content": "On Feb. 23, 2023, \ncentralized exchange\n (CEX) \nCoinbase\nunveiled to the\u00a0 public the \ntestnet\n for their very own \nEthereum\n \nLayer 2\n chain named \nBase\n. Built on the OP Stack by \nOptimism\n, Base is an \nOptimistic rollup\n, as part of Optimism\u2019s Superchain, to onboard Coinbase\u2019s 100 million users to the \non-chain\n world. This was a logical step forward for Coinbase, with the recent collapse of FTX and the increasingly apparent need for \ndecentralization\n away from centralized entities.\nSource: Base Mirror (\nlink\n)\nAfter months of public testnet, Base entered a gradual \nmainent\n rollout, beginning by opening to developers in early July. Since then, it has amassed a total of more than \n$147 million\n in \ntotal value locked\n (TVL). Base has finally completed their rollout to mainnet and is now publicly open to all users as of August 9, 2023.\nTo keep track of \nemerging projects and DApps on Base\n, check out CMC's \nBase Ecosystem category page\n, which currently has a combined market cap of $360 million.\nJoin us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that\u2019s right, millions love us!) \u2014 what are you waiting for?\nTo get to Base mainnet, all you need is a crypto \nwallet\n and some ETH. Currently, there are six easy ways to do so. (All of these methods will allow you to mint a commemorative \u201cBridge to Base\u201d \nNFT\n as a reward too, so get to work!)\nThe first way is via the \nofficial Base bridge\n, which just rolled out the week prior. The Base \nbridge\n currently supports the transfer of any of the four whitelisted \nERC-20\n tokens: ETH, \nCoinbase Wrapped Staked ETH\n (cbETH), \nDAI\n or \nUSDC\n. Do note that users are recommended to bridge ETH onto Base first as ETH is the \ngas\n token on the chain and will be necessary for all transactions.\nAs part of Base\u2019s on-chain quest campaign, \nOnchain Summer\n, users can also complete the first quest by bridging onto the chain through the Onchain Summer website. This will be the first of many quests in a series of activities to explore the on-chain world of music, art, gaming, advocacy and more on Base.\nSource: Base Mirror (\nlink\n)\nCoinbase Wallet users can also learn about Base and bridge ETH to the chain through their Coinbase app, or within the Coinbase Wallet interface on the \u201cExplore\u201d or \u201cBrowser\u201d tab. Coinbase users who mint any of the commemorative NFTs from the campaign will be granted a 60 days free trial of Coinbase One, unlocking benefits on Coinbase such as zero trading fees and boosted \nstaking\n rewards.\nLast but not least, interested users may also bridge to Base via several of the supporting on-chain quest providers: Galxe, Layer3 or Mint.fun, which all are partners of the Base Onchain Summer campaign. Some of these partners also provide special perks such as the chance to win an ETH reward from doing so or free minting of the commemorative NFT.\nCurrently, more than 27 million users have already completed the bridging process and have minted the \u201cBridge to Base\u201d NFT.\nOnce you\u2019ve got your ETH tokens on Base, the final step before interacting with any of the \ndecentralized applications\n (DApps), will be to add the Base network to your wallet. If you\u2019re using the Coinbase Wallet, Base will already be added by default. But if you\u2019re not, simply open your wallet and add a new network:\nNetwork Name: Base\nRPC Endpoint: https://mainnet.base.org\nChain ID: 8453\nCurrency Symbol: ETH\nBlock Explorer: https://basescan.org\nAlternatively, connecting to certain DApps such as \nSushi\n on the Base chain will automatically prompt you to add the Base network to your wallet as well.\nCoinbase have secured partnerships with numerous large crypto players for the launch of the Base mainnet.\nSource: Base Twitter (\nlink\n)\nOn the DApp layer, DeFi giants like \nAave\n, \nBalancer\n, Sushi have partnered up with the chain to provide the foundation of every healthy \nDeFi\n ecosystem to the chain on launch. NFT \nmarketplaces\n such as Magic Eden and \nOpensea\n have also partnered up with the chain for NFT trading.\nOn the infrastructure front, \nThe Graph\n, Infura, QuickNode, ThirdWeb and Blockdaemon are among the many infrastructure providers supporting builders on Base. \nOracles\n such as \nChainlink\n and Pyth are also available for DApps to build upon. For on-chain analytics, Dune, \nArkham Intelligence\n and Nansen are also among the partners looking to support Base in the near future.\nUnderlying it all, as part of the Optimism Superchain, Optimism is a key partner of Base. In fact, Coinbase has been actively supporting the development of the main upgrade in the upcoming Ethereum Cancun upgrade, \nEIP-4844\n, also known as Protodanksharding, which will benefit rollups significantly through reduction of fees by between 10-100x.\nDecentralized Exchanges\nWhile Base is still in its early days, \nmemecoins\n have already been deployed on the chain, racking up more than $100 million in trading volume on-chain even before the official mainnet launch to the public. Of course, there is no better way to be part of the action than through the \ndecentralized exchanges\n (DEX) on Base. Do note that memecoins are largely speculative and few have any fundamental value. Please do your due diligence before investing in any token or interacting with any protocol.\nThe largest DEX by TVL currently, is \nBaseSwap\n, which is a Base-native DEX holding $18 million in TVL. BaseSwap facilitates swaps between a handful of tokens on Base, including \nstablecoins\n and BaseSwap\u2019s own token, BSWAP.\nSource: Sushi.com\nPerhaps a more familiar name, the \nmulti-chain\n DEX, Sushi, has also deployed on Base as one of the Base official partners. Sushi has been facilitating the trades on most of the memecoins on Base, from \nBALD\n to \nTOSHI\n and many more.\nAside from these two, Ethereum top DEX, \nUniswap\n, is close behind, having attracted almost $1.1 million within just a day of its official launch on the chain.\nSource: GMX App\nOn the \nderivative\n DEX front, both \nGMX\n and \nSynthetix\n have also been given the green light by governance voters to deploy on Base. Commonly compared against each other, it will be interesting to observe how they fare on a new chain together.\nMoney Market\nAside from DEXs, \nmoney markets\n are key to any successful DeFi ecosystem. Currently, there is no significant money market protocol on Base yet.\nSource: Aave\nBut with Aave and \nEuler Finance\n as official Base partners, it is likely that we will see the launch of both protocols on the chain shortly after the official public launch. \nMoonwell DeFi\n, an up-and-coming money market platform on \nMoonriver\n, has also indicated its intention to deploy on the chain.\nYield Farms\nWhat is a DeFi ecosystem without \nyield farms\n?\nWeighted \nautomated market maker\n (AMM) Balancer has set up shop on Base, having accumulated more than $1.6 million in TVL across three main liquidity pools: DAI-USDC, \nWETH\n-DAI-USDC and BALD-WETH.\nSource: Balancer\nBeefy Finance\n is a protocol that aggregates all farms across Base and compounds yield. Currently supporting BaseSwap and Balancer pools, Beefy on Base has more than $1.65 million in TVL.\nNFT Marketplaces\nFinally, not forgetting the NFT collectors and traders among us, Opensea is live on the chain, and already supporting the listing and sales of the \u201cBridge to Base\u201d NFTs from the Onchain Summer campaign. Magic Eden is also a listed partner with Base and should be launching imminently on the chain, further expanding their reach into the NFT markets on \nEthereum Virtual Machine\n (EVM) chains.\nSource: Opensea\nFor the open-edition NFT collectors, Manifold and Zora are coming soon to the chain as well, with both officially partnered with Base for Onchain Summer.\nFor the builders out there looking to bring something new to Base, Onchain Summer also brings weeks of building to the chain. In a partnership with \nPropHouse\n, an initiative by NounsDAO, grants will be provided for innovative builders creating something in the various categories:\nOnchain Summer\n \u2013 August 9 - 18: Make art, a website, or whatever you\u2019re inspired to for Onchain Summer on Base.\nBuild on Base\n \u2013 August 12 - 23: Deploy a protocol, build infrastructure, or a new application on Base.\nStand with Crypto\n \u2013 August 14 - 24: Make a one minute video sharing a story about an on-chain use case, or advocating for sensible legislation.\nBased Accounts\n \u2013 August 16 - September 13: Build something that unlocks new or improved user experiences on Base using \naccount abstraction\n.\nOn top of these grants, the Base team has also teamed up with other Superchain L2s to organize Superhack, a hackathon from August 4 to 18, with more than $175K in prizes up for grabs.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).
