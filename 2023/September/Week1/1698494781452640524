And you need to ask yourself\nthe following questions: a) How many audits have been conducted on this\ncodebase? b) How trusted are the auditors? c) How impactful are the changes\nthat have been made? Generally speaking, a full audit is always the best\napproach, ignore the audit reports fully, don\u2019t even read them before you have\nfinalized your own audit. This is the most secure way and the way we prefer to\ndo it. However, sometimes, it is possible to do a diff-based audit, which we\nusually only offer once our auditors have personally audited the protocols.\nBut there might be exceptions for this rule. Finally, it all depends on the\nclients budget and often it is expected/assumed that the quotation will be on\nthe lower end since the codebase is already audited. But does that reduce the\nresources and time of work necessary to put in? Unfortunately not and at the\nend of the day, we are running a business and need to compensate our auditors\nfairly for the time they have put in, this obviously includes myself as well.\n(I often might take way less compared to solo-auditors which are <1 years in\nbusiness) Hopefully these thoughts can help some solo auditors with the\nregards of quoting these codebases."
