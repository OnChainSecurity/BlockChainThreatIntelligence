        "original_content": "Stake suffers \"suspicious activity\"\nBecky | Sep 04, 2023\n\nStake, one of the most prominent crypto gambling sites, has found itself at the centre of a significant security incident on September 4th. On the site, users withdrew a staggering $16 million as part of \"suspicious transactions\", according to security platform Cyvers Alerts.\n\nThe account responsible for these withdrawals has been named \"Stake.com Hacker\" on Etherscan, raising concerns that the funds may have been accessed illicitly through a stolen private key.\n\nBlockchain data shares insights into the nature of these hefty withdrawals from Stake.com\u2019s contracts. The series of transactions began at 12:48 pm, with the initial transfer channeling around $3.9 million in Tether (USDT) from Stake to the attacker\u2019s account. This was followed by two more transactions, both removing a total of 6,001 Ether (ETH), which, at current market value, translates to around $9.8 million. The attacker continued to move funds in the form of other cryptocurrency tokens, including approximately $1 million in USD Coin (USDC) and 333 Stake Classic (STAKE) tokens. Cyvers Alerts, the security platform tracking these transactions, estimated the overall drained crypto to be valued at a whopping $16 million.\n\nAfter successfully draining the funds from users\u2019 accounts, the suspected attacker proceeded to distribute them across multiple accounts. As of the time of writing, Stake has not issued any official statement regarding these suspicious withdrawals, leaving users and members of the crypto community on edge about the incident.\n\nStake, known for its crypto gambling protocol offering various games like dice, Blackjack, Lingo, and traditional casino games, in addition to sports betting options for sports like basketball, tennis, and volleyball, now faces a significant security challenge that could have repercussions on its reputation and user trust.\n\nThis incident is not an isolated one in the world of crypto gambling in 2023. On July 23, Alphapo, a payments provider for several crypto gambling sites including Hypedrop, Bovada, and Ignition, suffered a staggering $31 million in suspicious withdrawals."
