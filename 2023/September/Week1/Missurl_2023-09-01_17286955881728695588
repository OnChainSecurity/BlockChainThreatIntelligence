How can we provide cheaper and more secure Ethereum token transactions?\nWe address the need for cheaper and more secure Ethereum token transactions through the IERC protocol. Our primary focus is on reducing transaction fees and enhancing security within the Ethereum ecosystem. The existing concerns stem from security risks associated with smart contracts, which have led to skepticism among investors regarding new project tokens. Additionally, the high fees associated with exchanges like Uniswap deter newcomers in the crypto space. To tackle these issues, the IERC protocol offers the following advantages:\n\u2013 \nDecentralization:\n Each transaction\u2019s crucial information is recorded on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify transactions independently.\n\u2013 \nSecurity:\n Built on the Ethereum mining mechanism, our protocol leverages Ethereum\u2019s inherent security features to ensure the safety of transactions.\n\u2013 \nLow Cost:\n Interactions are encapsulated within transfer transactions, leading to reduced transaction fees.\nBy providing a more affordable and secure trading environment, our goal is to foster wider participation in the primary market and enhance the overall user experience within Ethereum token transactions.\n2. Why are there security risks in smart contracts causing apprehension in buying tokens of new projects?\nSecurity risks in smart contracts can lead to apprehension when considering tokens from new projects. Smart contracts are essentially lines of code, and like any software, they can contain errors and vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can exploit these weaknesses, potentially resulting in token theft or manipulation. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to tamper with token balances, freeze funds, or carry out other harmful actions. Naturally, this erodes trust among potential token buyers who fear the loss of their investments.\nTo address this issue, the IERC project is dedicated to establishing a more secure protocol. Our aim is to mitigate the security risks associated with smart contracts and create a safer transaction environment. By doing so, we hope to instill greater confidence in investors considering tokens from new projects.\n3. How can building a more complete protocol promote the development of the inscription technology?\nThe creation of a more comprehensive protocol serves as a catalyst for advancing the inscription technology. Firstly, our commitment to providing cost-effective and secure transaction fees addresses the high fees and security issues present in Ethereum token transactions, rendering new project tokens more attractive to users. Moreover, our protocol boasts decentralization, security, and low-cost advantages. Transaction information is recorded on-chain, promoting decentralization, and we utilize Ethereum\u2019s mining mechanism to bolster security. Moreover, by embedding interactive operations within transfer transactions, we achieve low-cost transactions. By capitalizing on these protocol strengths, we aim to establish a holistic ecosystem, enticing collaboration with quality projects. We also plan to deepen our technical path, engage in significant web3 events, and facilitate user-friendly access through API and SDK offerings. This comprehensive approach nurtures the inscription technology development.\n4. How does IERC20 reduce Gas consumption by utilizing the feature of carrying data in transfer transactions?\nIERC20 minimizes Gas consumption by leveraging Ethereum\u2019s transfer transactions, which carry Data. Our protocol operates on the premise of the minimum atomic gas consumption, set at 21,000 Gas Limit. By standardizing all operations on this foundation, IERC20 optimizes the Gas consumption within its ecosystem. For instance, during batch transfers, substantial Gas fees are saved as only a single gas fee is required for a multitude of transactions. This contrasts with traditional ERC20 tokens and, as a result, IERC20 is better poised to fulfil user needs in both technical and economic aspects. This approach simultaneously addresses Ethereum congestion issues and augments transaction speed.\n5. Which major web3 events do we plan to participate in?\nFollowing consultations with external technical teams, IERC has plans to participate in the Singapore 2049 conference actively. This engagement underscores our commitment to robust collaboration and technical advancement within the blockchain ecosystem.\nFor more about IERC20 at:\nOfficial website: \nwww.ierc20.com\nTwitter: @EthinscXYZ\nOfficial Telegram: \nt.me/IERC20OFFICIAL\nEcosystem report: \nhttps://gamma.app/public/IERC20-Protocol-Ecosystem-Report-l1xiy48dvhhc37k"
