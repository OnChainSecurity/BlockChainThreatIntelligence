However, its security has also met great challenges, and many security vulnerabilities and attack issues in blockchain-based services have emerged. Recently, security issues of blockchain have attracted extensive attention. However, there is still a lack of blockchain security research from a full-stack architecture perspective, as well as representative quantitative experimental reproduction and analysis. We aim to provide a security architecture to solve security risks in blockchain services from a full-stack architecture perspective. Meanwhile, we propose a formal definition of the full-stack security architecture for blockchain-based services, and we also propose a formal expression of security issues and defense solutions from a full-stack security perspective. We use ConCert to conduct a smart contract formal verification experiment by property-based testing. The security vulnerabilities of blockchain services in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and China Nation Vulnerability Database (CNVD) are selected and enumerated. Additionally, three real contract-layer real attack events are reproduced by an experimental approach. Using Alibaba's blockchain services and Identity Mixer in Hyperledger Fabric as a case study, the security problems and defense techniques are analyzed and researched. At last, the future research directions are proposed."
