The Root Cause\nCrypto exploits, often orchestrated by internal actors, exploit the decentralized nature of projects. They seize governance control, manipulate protocols, and siphon assets. Your crypto holdings can be worth a fraction of their value, and countering these attacks proves difficult.\n\n 2. Hacker Techniques\nGovernance attacks often require the majority of voting power, a surprisingly low threshold due to limited token holder participation. Malicious code hidden within innocent proposals is a favored tool. This enables attackers to make unchallenged changes, manipulate oracles, introduce rules, or siphon funds.\n\n 3. High-Profile Incidents\nRecent examples illustrate the gravity of the situation. Attackers, using malicious proposals, gained control of the Tornado Cash project, minting over $4 million worth of tokens. Beanstalk Farm suffered a loss of an estimated $80 million due to an attacker's manipulation of governance rules.\n\n 4. The Solution\nTo safeguard crypto projects, a second layer of governance security is imperative. Code and community alone cannot suffice. A system like a blockchain's 2FA, managed by transparent individuals, can uphold governance rules and prevent malicious actors from hijacking projects and looting investors' hard-earned assets.\n\nCrypto's future demands robust governance systems that stand as guardians against exploitation. It's time for change.  \n\n\n#CryptoSecurity\n \n#GovernanceReform\n \n#BlockchainSafety\n \n#Blockchain\n\n\n\n"
