Another \nrevenue generation channel\n is its use of \nfreelance IT workers abroad\n using fraudulent identification documents that obscure their true nationality. \n\n\n\"In recent years, there has been a marked rise in the size and scale of cyber attacks against cryptocurrency-related businesses by North Korea,\" TRM Labs \nsaid\n in June 2023. \"This has coincided with an apparent acceleration in the country's \nnuclear and ballistic missile programs\n.\"\n\n\nThe Lazarus Group and its sub-clusters as well as other hacking outfits linked to the country have been on a rampage in recent months, orchestrating a variety of malicious operations, including software supply chain attacks targeting companies such as \n3CX\n and \nJumpCloud\n as well as open-source repositories for \nJavaScript\n and \nPython\n.\n\n\nIn a post-mortem of the hack, CoinsPaid \ndisclosed\n that \nphony recruiters\n from crypto companies contacted its employees via LinkedIn and various Messengers with lucrative salaries in an attempt to trick them into \"installing the JumpCloud Agent or a special program to complete a technical task,\" a campaign known as \nOperation Dream Job\n.\n\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?
