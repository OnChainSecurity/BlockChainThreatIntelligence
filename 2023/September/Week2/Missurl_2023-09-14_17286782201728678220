        "original_content": "Even as major crypto hacking incidents declined this year, North Korea remained a powerful actor in cybercrime.\n\n\nAccording to a new report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, the North Korea\u2013linked hacker group Lazarus was responsible for over $300 million in losses across crypto hacking incidents in 2023, representing 17.6% of the year\u2019s total losses.\n\n\nThe Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the largest cyberattacks over the past decade, especially within the burgeoning crypto industry. First gaining notoriety after its \ncyberattack\n on Sony Pictures in 2014, Lazarus began targeting crypto protocols, stealing billions of dollars, including $600 million from the March 2022 hack of the \nRonin Network\n, a bridge used by the popular Web3 game \nAxie Infinity.\n\n\nWhile the exact composition of the Lazarus Group remains unknown, two North Korean \ndefectors\n told \nAl Jazeera\n in 2011 that education begins at institutions both within and outside North Korea, with some hackers working abroad from China or Russia. In 2023, an \ninvestigation\n by the \nWall Street Journal\n found that digital heists by North Korean hackers have netted more than $3 billion, which is being used to fund about 50% of the country\u2019s ballistic missile program.\n\n\nAccording to Immunefi, some $1.9 billion has been filched from crypto projects from 2021 to 2023, with the Ronin Network representing the largest exploit. Lazarus launched five successful attacks in 2023, including a $70 million \ntheft\n from the Hong Kong\u2013based crypto exchange CoinEx in September. At the time, the blockchain analytics firm Elliptic found that some of the funds stolen from CoinEx were sent to a crypto wallet address previously used by Lazarus to launder funds.\n\n\nDown year\n\n\nDespite the eye-popping numbers, 2023 has been a relatively slow year for crypto exploits. According to a new \nreport\n from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs, the amount of money stolen in hacks fell by over 50% this year, while the number of attacks remained relatively stable. \n\n\nWhile part of this decline can be attributed to a \ngrowing emphasis\n on cybersecurity within the crypto industry, as well as the increased focus of law enforcement agencies, a decrease in crypto prices perhaps also presented fewer lucrative opportunities. \n\n\nBut the Lazarus Group remains a serious threat. According to Immunefi, the group\u2019s strategy shifted in 2023, with hackers focusing on centralized finance, or CeFi, platforms like CoinEx, rather than decentralized protocols. Other incidents \ntargeted\n users of the noncustodial crypto wallet Atomic and the online casino and betting platform \nStake.com\n.\n\n\nAlong with tracing stolen funds, law enforcement officials have also sought to cut off access to so-called crypto mixers, which allow users to combine and distribute cryptocurrency, making it harder to track. The Treasury Department \nsanctioned\n the popular mixing service Tornado Cash in August 2022, with the Department of Justice \nindicting\n two of its founders for money laundering in September 2023. The Treasury Department \nsanctioned\n another mixer popular with Lazarus Group, Sinbad.io, in November. \n\n\nWith crypto exploits continuing, Treasury is seeking to expand its supervisory powers over the sector. Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo \npresented\n a proposal at a crypto industry policy summit in late November that would require higher \u201cknow your customer\u201d standards for decentralized platforms like mixers and wallet providers.\nLearn more about all things crypto with short, easy-to-read lesson cards.
