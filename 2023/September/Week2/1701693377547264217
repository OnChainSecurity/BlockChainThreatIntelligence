The\nunfortunate delay in response underscores the necessity for crypto projects to\nadopt real-time, AI-driven security solutions like Cyvers to prevent or\nmitigate damage from hacks. Reactive steps are no longer sufficient; we must\nprioritize proactive security to protect our digital assets and maintain the\ncommunity's trust. By integrating cutting-edge technology into our security\nframework, we can together create a more secure, trustworthy crypto ecosystem.\n\n[@coinexcom](/coinexcom)\n\n[#CoinEx]"
