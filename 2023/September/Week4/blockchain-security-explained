        "original_content": "Blockchain Security Explained in Simple Terms\nLast updated:\nSeptember 27, 2023\nGeekflare articles are written by humans for humans.\n\nBlockchain Security\nAbhijith G\nAbhijith G\nContributor\nBlockchain security is an important aspect of projects built using the blockchain technology. In this article, we\u2019ll simplify this concept for you.\n\nThe increase in crypto projects also led to the rise in blockchain-based hacks and attacks. According to Chainalysis, hackers stole crypto assets worth $3.8 billion in 2022.\n\nIn simpler words, blockchain is a technology used to store transactional information. For this reason, each block that contains data is linked together in a specific order.\n\nMoreover, the crypto space depends on blockchain technology and its effective security. For example, developers use this technology to build cryptocurrencies, NFTs, metaverse platforms, Web3 games, and more.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into the security aspects of a blockchain.\n\nWhat is Blockchain Security?\nBlockchain security involves a thorough risk management system to prevent potential hacks and security breaches. Moreover, this system ensures the blockchain network is strong enough to withstand possible attacks.\n\nBlockchain-Security\nIn addition, the transaction data is properly structured and connected between two blocks after the completion of each transaction. Besides, this data is secured using cryptography to avoid blockchain tampering.\n\nThe data stored in the blocks are accessible to all the network participants without discrimination. As a result, all participants can monitor, share, and record the transactional data.\n\nFinally, blockchain uses consensus mechanisms to verify and validate new blocks to the network. Therefore, only genuine and verified transactions are stored inside the block.\n\nThis well-structured working principle of blockchain makes it secure compared to other traditional methods. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that blockchain security is 100% foolproof, as there are chances for hacks and attacks.\n\nWhat are the Blockchain Security Challenges?\nLike any other advanced technology, blockchain also has security vulnerabilities. Therefore, there are four significant methods blockchain attackers mostly use. \n\n#1. Sybil Attacks\nA Sybil attack is a type of security violation where a blockchain is manipulated using numerous fake nodes or accounts. Simply put, it\u2019s similar to one person creating various social media accounts with different false names.\n\nsybil\nThis attack is named after \"Sybil,\" a novel character diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Likewise, hackers from the crypto space use fake identities to trick the blockchain system.\n\nSybil attacks can restrict other genuine users from the blockchain network. Finally, the hackers dominate the network and control other users\u2019 accounts and crypto assets.\n\n#2. 51% Attacks\nA 51% attack or majority attack involves a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network\u2019s hashing power. As a result, the attackers gain control to tamper with the blockchain security.\n\nIn addition, the attackers can restrict the confirmation of new transactions. Therefore, the attackers can process the transactions faster than other genuine miners.\n\nFinally, the 51% attacks bring down the reputation of the crypto token. Moreover, such attacks result in panic selling that leads to the token\u2019s price crash.\n\n#3. Phishing Attacks\nPhishing attacks involve scammers tricking victims to obtain personal information or private keys. In this case, the attacker impersonates a representative of prominent crypto platforms.\n\nphishing\nThe scammers mostly use text messages or emails to conduct phishing attacks. Besides, the victims are redirected to a website to input their login details.\n\nAfter collecting the user credentials, attackers gain illegitimate access to the victim\u2019s blockchain network. Finally, victims lose their valuable crypto assets stored on their platform or wallet.\n\n#4. Routing Attacks\nIn the case of routing attacks, hackers intercept user\u2019s data while transferring to an internet service provider (ISP). Therefore, there will be an interruption in the communication between the blockchain nodes.\n\nIn contrast to other blockchain security attacks, the network participants can\u2019t easily detect the threat. However, attackers silently collect the victim\u2019s information and confidential data. \n\nIn addition, the attackers misuse user\u2019s data to get away with their valuable crypto assets. Mostly, the victims realize about the attack only after the theft.\n\nBlockchain Types and Its Security Differences\nNow, let\u2019s discuss the types of blockchains and their security aspects:\n\n#1. Public Blockchains\nAs the name indicates, public blockchain is open to everyone. As a result, anyone can join and transact on this network without any permission.\n\nThis open variant allows every user to store a copy of the transaction data. Therefore, this blockchain is entirely transparent to the public. \n\nMoreover, this transparency creates trust among the community members. Besides, this blockchain doesn\u2019t depend on any middlemen for its functioning. \n\nThe openness and wide accessibility feature of public blockchain makes it more secure than other blockchains. For this reason, it is difficult to tamper with the blockchain with challenges like 51% attack.\n\n#2. Private Blockchains\nPrivate blockchains operate within a closed network with limited participants. Moreover, this blockchain is managed and controlled by a single entity.\n\nThe smaller number of users allows this blockchain to operate quickly. In addition, to join a network, users need to obtain permission or invitation from the higher authorities that operate the blockchain.\n\nThe dependency on a single person or organization weakens the security of private blockchains. Therefore, it is comparatively easy for hackers to attack such blockchain networks.\n\n#3. Hybrid Blockchains\nHybrid blockchain involves the combination of both private and public blockchains. Moreover, this blockchain is customizable based on the interest of its central authority.\n\nThis network can regularly modify the rules according to the circumstances. Besides, this blockchain doesn\u2019t disclose the transaction data outside its closed ecosystem.\n\nHybrid blockchains use private nodes that provide greater security and privacy to the network. Moreover, the private nature of this blockchain restricts the network from potential 51%  attacks. \n\n#4. Consortium Blockchains\nConsortium blockchains are developed and managed by multiple entities or organizations. In addition, you need to obtain access to join this network.\n\nMost importantly, this blockchain facilitates effective collaborative work among similar entities. Moreover, it\u2019s easy to make crucial decisions as the number of participants is fewer.\n\nFurthermore, the participant\u2019s productivity increases as the network operates on minimal computational capacity. As a result, users can enjoy the benefits of faster transactions with less fees.\n\nConsortium blockchain\u2019s centralized network structure is vulnerable to hacks and attacks. Moreover, the limited participation also allows corrupt participants to take over the majority of the network.\n\nBest Blockchain Security Practices\n#1. Regular Smart Contract Audits and Tests\nThe vulnerabilities in smart contracts can create security issues for a blockchain. Therefore, it is essential to conduct smart contract audits regularly.\n\naudit-1\nMost importantly, choose top smart contract auditing firms to get the best audit reports. Moreover, these firms will also provide expert suggestions after the final audit.\n\n#2. Implementation of Multi-factor Authentication\nStrong authentication measures can play a crucial role in restricting unauthorized access. As a result, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) makes it more difficult for attacks.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is the most commonly used type of MFA that combines two authentication methods. The most popular methods include passwords, PINs, and biometric locks.\n\n#3. Regular Security Update\nHackers are in constant search for security vulnerabilities to attack blockchain networks. Therefore, it\u2019s important to detect and fix such glitches at the earliest.\n\nsecurity-update\nMoreover, it\u2019s best to invest in the best security software to avoid potential hacks. Besides, hiring a reputed blockchain security team can enhance the safety of the network.\n\n#4. Opting Decentralized and Consensus Mechanism\nA decentralized network is interconnected with every participant without any intermediary. As a result, hackers find it extremely difficult to tamper with such blockchain networks.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s safer to implement consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW). For instance, prominent blockchain projects use these two mechanisms to safeguard their users\u2019 assets and data.\n\nImportance of Blockchain Penetration Test\nWhen it comes to blockchain security, penetration tests help to identify potential vulnerabilities in a network. As a result, security professionals conduct this test involving the simulation of cyber attacks.\n\nBlockchain penetration test provides a complete overview of the safety of a network. Therefore, the developers can detect and fix the glitches before the possible exploitation.\n\nFor example, hackers stole over $600 million from a crypto platform, Poly Network. This unfortunate incident was due to flaws in the security contract.\n\nTo sum up, a proper blockchain penetration test would have avoided such a massive hack.
