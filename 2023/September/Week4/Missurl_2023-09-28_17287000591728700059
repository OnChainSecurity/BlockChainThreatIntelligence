        "original_content": "Understanding OP Stack & Superchains: The most simple yet powerful framework to build Optimistic Rollups\nOptimistic Rollups\nThe blockchain\u2019s trilemma of scalability has created various sustainability challenges for \nweb3\n projects. However, Layer2 solutions like \nRollups\n have tackled this issue well. Blockchain startups with a huge number of users and high traffic congestion can now build their own \nrollup chain\n to achieve high levels of customizability, security, and, most importantly\u2013 near-infinite scalability. OP-Stack is one such standardized, easy-to-deploy framework that facilitates the rapid development of \nOptimistic Rollup chains\n. OP-stack basically breaks down the complex process of building optimistic Rollups into a simplified process by offering a complete set of software components, tools, and \nframeworks\n.\nWith time, \nOp Stack\n evolved to become a full-fledged stack. Speaking about the most recent addition to \nOP Stack Rollups\n, it is the concept of Superchain. This Superchain, as per OP Stack, is a collection of chains that consists of various layers, including bridging, on-chain governance, upgrades, communication, layer, and more\u2013 which are all built with OP stack. Through this article, we will dive deeper into the concept of Opstack and its important component\u2013 Superchains. This way, we will be able to understand OP stack and Superchain\u2019s value proposition in enhancing the capabilities of Layer-2 scaling solutions.\nUnderstanding OP-Stack\nOP-Stack\n is a standardized, open-source, and shared developer stack that enables projects to rapidly build optimistic Rollup. Op Stack includes different modular software components that together form the infrastructure for the \nOptimism network\n. OP stack offers already-built modules that web3 projects can leverage based on their project\u2019s requirements for utility, simplicity, and extensibility. Modules on OP Stack are simple and understandable. And, being open-source, anyone can leverage them to build their \nRollup chain\n. However, these modules are extensive so that users can customize the existing modules and serve the specific needs of their use case.\nDecoding the Idea of OP Superchains\nGiven that OP Stack allows \nOptimistic Rollups\n to be deployed and maintained on a common infrastructure, \nOptimism ecosystem\n came with the idea that a high degree of \ninteroperability\n can be achieved between all different \nrollup networks\n. This forms an interconnected ecosystem of Layer-2s\u2013 known as OP Superchains, enabling independent Layer-2s to seamlessly interoperate and transact. By offering this shared development stack, the Superchain allows web3 projects to build \nOptimistic Rollups\n that not only provide unprecedented scalability and customizability to the associated \ndApps\n but also allow the applications to gain interoperability. Superchains achieves \ncross-chain\n messaging across various OP Chains through an Optimism bridge that sits between OP Stack chains and Layer-1 blockchain like \nEthereum\n.\nBesides enabling cross-chain interoperability, Superchain also eliminates the security trade-offs that come with the traditional multi-architecture of blockchain. For this, Superchain enables horizontal scaling, which maintains compliance despite the more number of chains added in the network. Superchain is said to be the next big upgrade after Optimism\u2019s Bedrock.\nThe architecture and different layers of OP Stack\nThe standard architecture of \nRollups\n built with \nOP Stack\n includes different stack layers and specific modules that allow for the building of high-performing Optimistic Rollups. Speaking about how an OP Stack chain performs L2-specific functionality, let\u2019s understand the whole mechanism through the below image which include the following five core concepts\u2013\nExecution Node: op-geth\nRollup Node: op-node\nProving scheme: Cannon\nBatch submission of L2 blocks\nDerivation of L1 Block data\n1. Execution node:\n Op-geth is an extended Ethereum\u2019s execution client that can handle specific functionality on Layer-2 rollups, for example\u2013 accepting token deposits from Layer-1. This layer of the \nOP Stack\n defines all functions responsible for mutation of the execution state. Here, State transitions are triggered based on the inputs received from the \nRollup Node\n (sequence and validators) via Engine API.\n2. Rollup node\n: OP-node or Rollup node include sequencers and \nvalidators\n. This node can be run both in the sequencer and verifier mode. Here, Sequencers are in charge of batching the processed transactions from Layer-2 and posting them on the main L1 chain. Sequencers define the way transactions on a OP Stack-based chain will be collected and published. Whereas, validators/verifiers check the validity of the batched transactions and submit proof against any fraud if detected.\n3. Proving scheme: \nCannon is an updated version of Geth that is responsible for running EVM within VMs during the stage of fraud detection and proofing. It\u2019s basically an on-chain dispute engine that coordinates with sequencers and verifiers via \nAPI\n for the purpose of proving a faulty transaction.\n4. Batch submission:\n Sequencers once batch all the processed transactions, and verifiers validate it, then Sequencers submit the batched transactions to Layer-1; \nEthereum\n.\n5. Derivation:\n Derivation allows sequencers and \nvalidators\n to derive raw data from Layer-1 to process them and form final inputs that are provided to the execution layer for passing the transaction load off this chain. To accomplish this task, the Derivation layer can use Standard \nEthereum\n Engine API and the current system state.\nAll these first three components\u2013 execution node, rollup node, and providing scheme interact with base chain (Layer-1) through a token bridge for the purpose of final transaction settlement, achieving consensus, and data availability.\nWho all are building Rollups using the OP-Stack codebase?\nOptimism\u2019s Superchain vision, empowered by the \nOP-Stack\n which has been allowing all kinds of \nweb3\n projects, from newly launched ones to the biggest players to build \nOptimistic Rollups\n. Coinbase, Gitcoin, and Zora have already announced their launch of optimistic rollups. Coinbase, being the most prominent name, has recently launched an OP stack-based rollup called Base. With this, Coinbase plans to bring its 100M users on the \nrollup chain\n, thereby creating no network congestion on the main chain.\nRegarding Zora, they leverage OP Stack to build their \nOP Stack\n-based rollup chain and thus expand their Ethereum-based project for millions of new artists, creators, and worldwide communities. Their \nRollup launch\n will make their transaction on \nEthereum\n cheaper while increasing throughput and enhancing overall user experience.\nAlso, BSC chose the Optimism Roll-Op Stack to launch opBNB for leveraging their maximum modularity to enhance performance. \nBNB\n claims that their OP based chain\u2013 opBNB can achieve the capacity of processing 4000+ TPS, and it can offer 1 second block time with a transaction fee lower than $0.005. Hence, launching the \nOP stack\n chain seems a great fit for BNB.\nThe efficacy of the \nOp-Stack rollup\n solutions attracts other players as well as World Coin, which is heavily working on \ndecentralized identities\n and Coinbase\u2019s Base, which has already supported one of the most ambitious projects across DeSo, Friend.Tech. This is just the initial stage of how \nOp-Stack\n could supercharge the rollups ecosystem and envisage a new demand for \nR-a-a-S or RollUps-as-a-Service\n to help scale the L2s for further adoption ahead.\nHow can Zeeve RaaS help you launch your own rollups?\nZeeve\u2019s Rollups-as-a-Service is optimized to support all kinds of \nRollups \nimplementations\u2013 including \nOptimistic Rollups\n and \nZk Rollups.\n The DevOps team at \nZeeve\n has extensive experience in using the OP Stack framework, its already-built modules, tools, and codebase.
