Holverson\nU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nLitigation Release No. 25865 / September 28, 2023\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Arline E. Woodbury and Joyce L. Holverson, No. 23-cv-14255 (N.D. Ill. filed September 28, 2023)\nSEC Charges Illinois and New Jersey Promoters of Multi-Million Dollar CoinDeal Scheme\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Arline Woodbury of Ridgewood, New Jersey and Joyce Holverson of River Forest, Illinois for their involvement in a fraudulent investment scheme named CoinDeal that raised millions of dollars through false claims of trillion-dollar returns.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Woodbury and Holverson served as downstream promoters for the scheme, which claimed investors would generate returns through the imminent sale of an anonymous blockchain technology. The Commission filed a related action in federal court on January 4, 2023 against eight defendants, including Neil Chandran, who allegedly orchestrated the scheme.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Woodbury and Holverson formed their own investor groups to take advantage of bonuses and payouts offered through CoinDeal. From at least January 2019, Woodbury and Holverson allegedly raised more than $3 million from hundreds of investors. The complaint alleges that Woodbury and Holverson disseminated materially false and misleading statements to investors about the purported value of the deal, the parties involved in the transaction, the return on investment, and the riskless nature of the investment. According to the complaint, no sale of CoinDeal ever occurred and no distributions were made to CoinDeal investors. The complaint further alleges that Woodbury and Holverson collectively misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds for personal use.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges Woodbury and Holverson with violating the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Woodbury and Holverson were also charged with aiding and abetting certain of Neil Chandran\u2019s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint seeks officer and director bars, disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions against Woodbury and Holverson.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Dante A. Rold\u00e1n, Caryn Trombino, Steven Tremaglio, and Lynette Nichols-Newman, and supervised by Anne Graber Blazek, all of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Michael D. Foster, also of the Chicago Regional Office.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued investor alerts on the red flags of investment fraud."
