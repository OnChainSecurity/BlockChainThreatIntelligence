Let\u2019s Take A Look At His Transactions\nBest Owie\nBest Owie\n1 year ago\n3 mins read\n\nEthereum Vitalik Buterin\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin has multiple public wallets that carry a significant amount of ETH and these wallets are religiously tracked by on-chain sleuths. This is why whenever the founder makes a withdrawal, the destination of the ETH being sent is closely followed and recent reports reveal that Buterin has been sending significant amounts of ETH out to different wallets.\n\nTwo Vitalik Buterin Transactions Spark Speculations\nIn the early hours of Monday, the on-chain data tracking platform PeckShieldAlert took to X (formerly Twitter) to share some interesting movements that have been taking place in wallets said to belong to Buterin. This time around, the tracker flagged a single transaction carrying 3,000 ETH.\n\nRelated Reading\nXRP whales price\nXRP Price Faces Immense Sell Pressure That Could Trigger 20% Decline\n1 year ago\n\nThe 3,000 ETH, worth roughly $4.95 million at the time of the transfer was sent out from the well-known Vitalik.eth wallet to another wallet identified publicly as Vb2. This brought the latter\u2019s balance to 3,017 ETH, worth a little over $4.95 million.\n\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner?

The transaction which was also reported by PeckShield alert showed that Buterin had sent 600 ETH worth around $1 million at the time to the Coinbase crypto exchange.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert vitalik.eth labeled-address has transferred 3K $ETH (~$4.95M) to Vb 2 labeled-address pic.twitter.com/f8ETU42TrD\n\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 28, 2023\n\nFor many, however, this transaction was insignificant in the grand scheme of things and did not lead to a cause for alarm. The most recent transaction also follows in the same vein since it looks like the billionaire founder is just redistributing his assets to other wallets.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price chart from Tradingview.com (Vitalik Buterin)\n\n\n\nETH price struggles coming out of the weekend | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\nIs This Why ETH\u2019s Price Is Struggling?\nSo far, there is no indication that Buterin\u2019s wallet movements have anything to do with the ETH price decline. As already mentioned above, the ETH liquidity is too deep for a $1 million sell to trigger such a decline, which would suggest something else is behind the coin\u2019s struggles.\n\nRelated Reading\nEthereum whales\nEthereum Whales Ready For Next Leg-Up After Buying 56,000 ETH\n1 year ago\n\nThe most obvious factor is that the broader crypto market has been taking a hit and ETH has not been left out. Bitcoin fell from $28,000 to below $26,000, taking the majority of the market down with it. As a result, investor sentiment swung far into the negative which is preventing new money from coming into the market.\n\nWith the bear market waxing strong, there could be more decline to come for the digital asset until investor sentiment improves and the market starts to recover once more. For now, ETH is still ranging above $1,640 as bears and bulls are locked in a tug-of-war for control.\n\n\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Police1, chart from TradingView.com\nTweet123\nShare196\nShare\nSend\nBest Owie\nBest Owie\nBest Owie is a seasoned managing editor with a wealth of experience currently serving as the Managing Editor at NewsBTC.
