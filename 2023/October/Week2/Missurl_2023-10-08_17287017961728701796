The site is currently under a DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) attack. We are working on a solution to get everyone\u2019s funds recovered and have the Arena move forward.\u201d\n\n\nAmid criticisms, the SocialFi app, which just launched in late September, \nsays\n it will not cease operations because of the incident.\n\n\n\u201cImportant news: we have secured the resources to close the gap caused by the exploit. Additionally, a special white hat development team is coming in to rapidly review the security of the platform.\u00a0 \n\n\nWe will re-open the contract with all the funds in full after a full security audit. This will happen very soon. We\u2019re not going anywhere. The Arena marches on.\u201d\n\n\nAVAX is down by 4% over the past 24 hours. The token is currently trading for $10.35.\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 \nSubscribe\n to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\n\nCheck \nPrice Action\n\n\nFollow us on \nX\n, \nFacebook\n and \nTelegram\n\n\nSurf \nThe Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
