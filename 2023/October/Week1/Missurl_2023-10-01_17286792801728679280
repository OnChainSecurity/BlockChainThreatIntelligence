        "original_content": "What are digital assets?\nDigital assets are electronic files of data that can be owned and transferred by individuals, and used as a currency to make transactions, or as a way of storing intangible content, such as computerised artworks, video or contract documents. \nExamples of digital assets include cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, so-called asset-backed \nstablecoins\n, such as tether, and \nnon-fungible tokens\n (NFTs) \u2014 certificates of ownership of original digital media.\nHow are digital assets bought, sold and held?\nRecords of ownership of digital assets are held securely on a\u00a0type of decentralised database, or electronic ledger, called\u00a0a blockchain, which is distributed among its users. \nThis structure enables the transfer of digital assets without\u00a0the need to go through a central party, such as a bank, broker or intermediary. This can make transactions quicker and easier.\nWhat exactly is a blockchain?\nA \nblockchain is a type of electronic ledger\n, in which digital asset transactions are recorded in blocks of data that are \u201cchained\u201d together in a specific order and protected using complex computer \u201chash\u201d codes. \nDetails of every new transaction must be verified by a network of computers, or nodes, before they can be added to the ledger. This verification process involves the details of the\u00a0transaction\u00a0being sent to all of the nodes in the network, which attempt to solve complex mathematical problems to prove that the transaction is valid. A majority must conclude that it is valid \u2014 it must be a consensus decision by the network.\nFor security, records of who owns digital assets are stored using blockchain, a decentralised database\n \u00a9 Bloomberg\nAll the nodes in the network can access the information and compete to be the next to validate a new transaction and add it to a block. Unlike traditional ledgers, therefore, a blockchain database is decentralised and there is no master version.\nHow is a blockchain built up?\nEach consensus-verified transaction is added to a block of data, and the blocks are connected to each other in a chain. As each new block is added, the blockchain becomes a growing database of time-stamped transactions that, in practical terms, is impossible to alter.\nWhat makes a blockchain secure and unalterable?\nEach new block that is appended to the blockchain contains a complex and unique computer-generated code, called a hash. This is like a digital \u201cfingerprint\u201d. Each block also contains the hash, or fingerprint, of the previous block in the chain, to which it is now attached. These matching hash codes prove that the chain is intact, in the correct order, and unaltered.\nIf any attempt is made to tamper with the contents of a block, this will generate a new hash for that block, which will then differ from the hash of the previous block \u2014 breaking the chain. In order to conceal this tampering, a hacker would have to recalculate the hash code held in the next block in the chain, which would have the effect of changing that block\u2019s own hash, requiring the next block\u2019s hash codes to be recalculated, and so on. Every hash in every subsequent block in the chain would therefore have to be recalculated \u2014 a process requiring so much computing power that it would be extremely difficult. The database is therefore, in effect, \u201cappend-only\u201d \u2014 it is not possible for anyone to go back and revise it later.\nCardano is among the rivals to the ethereum platform, which is used to run 60-70 per cent of blockchains \n \u00a9 Bloomberg\nWho provides this blockchain technology?\nSeveral technology platform providers facilitate the building of blockchains. According to industry estimates, 60-70 per cent of public blockchains are run on the Ethereum platform. Some believe this could become the preferred provider of technology for a range of decentralised processes. However, newer rival blockchain platforms with greater processing capacity have now sprung up, including Avalanche, Solana and Cardano. Solana has been used as a platform for the sale of new collections of NFTs.\nWhat are the benefits of holding digital assets?\nDigital assets can be quicker to issue than paper-based or physical assets. Their electronic-only format can also streamline the transaction process, reducing administrative and physical storage costs. These are some of the reasons that central banks and commercial banks are considering the use of digital assets and blockchain technologies.\nWhat are the risks of holding digital assets?\nDigital assets held on a blockchain can pose both investment and security risks.\nThe main investment risk is that digital assets that are not backed by physical holdings or fiat currencies issued by\u00a0governments or central banks can fluctuate widely in value \u2014 driven by sentiment and demand. Cryptocurrencies\u00a0such as bitcoin have been known to double or halve in value against conventional currencies within the space of a few months.\nThe Bank of England said this month that a \u2018massive collapse\u2019 in cryptoasset prices is a \u2018plausible scenario\u2019\n \u00a9 AFP via Getty Images\nIn October, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe warned: \u201cA massive collapse in crypto asset prices, similar to what we have seen in tech stocks [in 2000] and subprime [mortgage-backed securities in 2008], is certainly a plausible scenario.\u201d A similar risk is that the high prices currently being paid for NFTs \u2014 such as the $69m paid for a token conferring ownership of a digital collage by the artist Beeple \u2014 will not be sustained.\nThe main security risk is that digital asset exchanges, which allow individuals to buy and sell assets such as cryptocurrencies, can be hacked by criminals. A further risk is posed by electronic \u201cwallets\u201d which can be used to store cryptocurrencies and are protected by complex 16-digit \u201cprivate keys\u201d. \nCybercriminals\n can trick users into giving away their private keys, and then steal their assets. Or users who forget their private keys can permanently \nlose access to their assets\n, as there is no central ownership register.\nWhat else can blockchains be used for?\nBanks and fintechs have been working on ways to use blockchains to improve payment systems. By using distributed ledger technology, payment systems can, in theory, be made faster and more secure. Some banks are experimenting with issuing bonds on blockchains, as well, which could streamline the existing process, cut costs and reduce risk in the settlement process. The World Bank has already sold and managed bonds using blockchain technology, and the European Investment Bank recently raised \u20ac100m from a two-year bond registered on the Ethereum blockchain network. \nA blockchain\u2019s decentralised structure could also remove the need for intermediaries \u2014 so bonds would no longer need to be registered with a central securities depository.\nWeekly newsletter\nFor the latest news and views on fintech from the FT\u2019s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter \n#fintechFT\nSign up here with one click"
