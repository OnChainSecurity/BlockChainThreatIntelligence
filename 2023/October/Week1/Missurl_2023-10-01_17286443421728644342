Introduction\nIn the modern digital landscape, the field of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) has assumed an indispensable role in safeguarding the increasingly complex digital realm against persistent and sophisticated cyber threats. As the digital interdependencies grow deeper and more intricate, expanding the attack surface of organizations, cyber adversaries continually evolve their tactics, seeking to infiltrate systems, compromise data, and undermine cybersecurity. Recognizing the dynamic nature of these threats, organizations have shifted their focus from reactive cybersecurity measures towards more proactive and predictive approaches.\nIn this paper, we acknowledge that while there might be many variations, CTI is generally referenced in a similar manner across different perspectives. For the context of our work, we specifically adhere to the NIST publication 800-150 definition [\n1\n], being any information related to a threat that has been aggregated, transformed, analyzed, interpreted, or enriched to provide the necessary context for decision-making processes, which might help an organization protect itself against a threat or detect the activities of an actor. This definition guides our exploration, ensuring a consistent and precise framework for our\u00a0study.\nUnder this definition, CTI is interrelated among other factors, with collection, analysis, transformation, and dissemination, serving as a comprehensive framework for our research, ensuring methodological consistency. Importantly, this definition contributes significantly to the formulation of our research questions, particularly in the context of the convergence with blockchain technology. By aligning with NIST 800-150, our study not only adheres to established standards but also facilitates an in-depth exploration of the convergence between CTI and blockchain. This integration enhances the precision of our methodology, providing a robust basis for investigating this dynamic landscape of cybersecurity.\nCTI, once primarily reactive in nature, has now grown as part of a proactive intelligence collection and decision-making process, aimed at enhancing preparedness against and facilitating mitigation of cyber threats. This transformation relies on the collection and analysis of timely, relevant, and actionable information about potential and existing threats, as well as the tactics and attack patterns employed by adversaries. This paradigm shift has empowered organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses, identify vulnerabilities, and counter potential attacks more effectively [\n2\n]. However, with this expansion in scope and capability comes a corresponding challenge; the management, storage, analysis, and sharing of vast and sensitive threat intelligence data.\nThe integration of CTI with blockchain technology presents a promising solution to address these challenges. In a broader context, CTI encompasses the practice of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data and insights related to cyber threats. The information offered in CTI varies depending on its depth and nature, encompassing an amalgamation of elements such as threat actors, attack patterns, methodologies, motives, threat severity, the broader threat landscape, Techniques\u2013Tactics\u2013Procedures (TTPs), and Indicators of Compromise (IoC) [\n3\n]. At every level of CTI, the mechanism for sharing such intelligence plays a pivotal role. This sharing mechanism is the focal point of dedicated endeavors by governmental institutions, private sector entities, IT security vendors, the IT industry, and security researchers. Their collective effort is geared toward establishing a dependable, timely, and accurate framework for the dissemination of CTI.\nOn the other hand, blockchain, renowned for its robust and tamper-resistant properties as a distributed ledger technology, introduces a transformative shift in data and transaction management. Beyond its foundational feature of immutability, blockchain shines with its exceptional attributes of availability and scalability. Its decentralized network ensures data redundancy across multiple nodes, guaranteeing accessibility even during system failures or cyberattacks.\u00a0This scalability is vital as CTI accumulates vast volumes of threat-related data.\nThe convergence of CTI with blockchain technology has ignited growing interest within the cybersecurity community, offering the potential to revolutionize the threat intelligence landscape. By harnessing blockchain\u2019s innate attributes of immutability, availability, and scalability, CTI stakeholders are in position to follow through an era of secure, transparent, and collaborative methods for managing, analyzing, and sharing threat intelligence, enhancing data integrity, ensuring uninterrupted access to critical intelligence, and providing a trusted platform for cross-industry cooperation. In this synergy, CTI and blockchain have the potential to bolster cybersecurity efforts and overcome the persistent challenges of securely handling and disseminating critical threat information.\nIn light of these developments, this literature review embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the recent advancements and emerging trends that lie at the intersection of CTI and blockchain technology. Specifically, we reviewed research papers published during the last 5 years to investigate the various proposals, methodologies, models, and implementations related to the distributed ledger technology and how this technology can be used to collect, store, analyze, and share CTI in a secured and controlled manner, as well as how this combination can further support additional dimensions such as quality assurance, reputation, and trust. Our aim is to contribute to the existing knowledge in this field by identifying and incorporating state-of-the-art methods and techniques found in the literature.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured and organized as follows: \nSection 2\n presents the existing research that has been performed in the field of this review and the differences from our scope of work. \nSection 3\n outlines the research methodology, including the scope, the objectives, the research questions, the search strategy, and the eligibility criteria of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR). \nSection 4\n presents the results and the categorization criteria of this review. \nSection 5\n presents the literature review of the research papers in the scope of this SLR. \nSection 6\n discusses the results in the context of the research conducted in the field, while \nSection 7\n provides some limitations to our study. Finally, \nSection 8\n refers to the threats of validity of our research, and \nSection 9\n presents the conclusions of our work.\n  2. Related Work\nReviewing the current landscape of related work in the field of CTI, it is evident that a rich and dynamic mass of research has been developed in response to the evolving threat landscape, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of CTI\u2019s role in enhancing cybersecurity resilience and response strategies [\n4\n,\n5\n]. In addition, similar emerging research activity applies to distributed ledger technology, which is increasingly seen as a vital component of modern cyber security with a very wide spectrum of applications [\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n]. As blockchain technology continues to mature and gain adoption, it holds the promise of reshaping how CTI is collected, stored, and shared, ultimately strengthening the collective defense against cyber threat evolution.\nFurthermore, non-surprisingly, numerous studies have focused during the last years on various aspects of CTI, ranging from its fundamental concepts and data sources to advanced methodologies, sharing mechanisms, and integration with cutting-edge technologies like blockchain. By converging CTI with distributed ledger technology, and by harnessing blockchain\u2019s inherent security attributes, such as data immutability, decentralized architecture, and cryptographic safeguards, CTI stakeholders aim to create a more transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative ecosystem for threat intelligence ecosystem.\nWhile CTI and blockchain technology have both seen substantial individual attention in the literature, the synergy arising from their convergence represents a compelling and promising area for inquiry. Nonetheless, according to our research, there have been relatively few literature reviews found in this field, scoping the evolving relationship and convergence of CTI and blockchain technology research. Specifically, the lack of studies that holistically scope and present the trajectory of research developments in these two domains combined is noticeable.\nEl-Kosairy et al. [\n9\n] conducted a survey on CTI sharing based on blockchain, collecting the latest research contributions that use blockchain to overcome the conventional CTI problems, comparing them for awareness about the different methods used, and pointing out uncovered areas for further research. It is important to note that this study presented the advancements in integrating CTI with blockchain technology, emphasizing pertinent challenges within the domain. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this study does not claim to be exhaustive in encapsulating the entirety of relevant research papers published in the field up to the point of review.\nDunnett et al. [\n10\n], presented their research about the challenges and opportunities of blockchain for CTI sharing. Nevertheless, their research was conducted in early 2022, which means it does not encompass the most recent developments in the field. Furthermore, their study appears to be more widely oriented and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the entire body of literature related to this topic.\nFinally, Saxena et al. [\n11\n] presented CTI challenges in a relationship with blockchain and presented a conceptual and abstract proposal for a blockchain-based CTI sharing model. However, their study, while insightful, does not comprehensively capture the entire landscape in the subject area of our research.\nThe scarcity of comprehensive updated literature reviews in this intersection underscores the need for our research, as it aims to bridge this gap by providing an in-depth analysis and synthesis of the evolving CTI and blockchain landscape. In that respect, we seek to offer a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the research in this emerging field, underpinning the potential of the amalgamation of CTI and blockchain technology.\nA comparison table between existing related work and our systematic review is depicted in .\n\n\nTable 1.\n\n    Comparison with related work.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3. Research Methodology\nIn this section, we outline the procedures that we applied during our review process, emphasizing how we identified, screened, selected, and analyzed articles that incorporate the utilization of blockchain technology as a foundational component in the domain of CTI. Our methodological approach involves a systematic literature review, which was conducted in accordance with established guidelines to comprehensively survey and synthesize the existing scope of research on this specific intersection. Through this detailed review process, we aim to identify insights, trends, and potential challenges related to the use of blockchain in relation to the CTI lifecycle, contributing to a holistic understanding of its impact on the field.\n  3.1. Research Scope\nOur research scope focuses on the dynamic interplay and overlap between blockchain technology and CTI, with a particular emphasis on their integration within the broader framework of the various other contributing factors, such as stages of the CTI lifecycle, supporting technology, CTI levels, and blockchain type. The scope of the present research is graphically shown in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n      Scope of the research.\n\n\n  \n\n\n  3.2. Research Objective and Research Questions\nTaking into consideration that the research in the field of CTI and blockchain has grown during recent years, the objective of the present review is to present a comprehensive and systematic bibliographic review of related work that was published in the last five years and, if possible, identify the areas and potential trends that show increased research interest.\nThe research questions (RQs) that this review is focusing on answering are the following:\nRQ1:\nWhich areas of the CTI lifecycle (direction, collection, processing, dissemination) [\n12\n] have attracted more research interest?\nRQ2:\nWhich level of CTI data (strategic, operational, tactical, technical) [\n12\n] is in the scope of each research paper?\nRQ3:\nWhat aspects of CTI data, like trust, reputation, privacy, quality, and sustainability, are in the scope of each study?\nRQ4:\nWhich particular supporting technology or methodology is used in each research?\nRQ5:\nWhat type of blockchain technology is used (permissioned vs. permissionless and/or private vs. public)?\nRQ6:\nWhat is the implementation maturity of the proposed solutions?\n  3.3. SLR Method\nTo meet the research objectives of this paper, we opted for the systematic literature review (SLR) method. SLR is a widely applied approach in various research domains, including computer science and technology [\n13\n]. It is characterized by its systematic and comprehensive nature, involving well-defined steps and methods [\n14\n]. In that respect, we specifically adopted the PRISMA methodology [\n15\n] as the research method for this paper. The aim is to ensure an unbiased selection procedure and criteria for accounting all published articles relevant to our research scope. The transparency inherent to the SLR process forms the foundation for achieving high-quality standards in both the process and the results. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the search is limited to specific databases, which entails the risk of potentially missing a portion of the published research worldwide. In the forthcoming sections, we provide a detailed account of the research and analysis steps.\nThe next procedural step that has to be applied is the definition of the research strategy, which encompasses the selection of data sources, research string, and the criteria for selection. Subsequently, the process involves an initial screening phase, wherein titles and abstracts are evaluated for relevance. Following this, relevant information is extracted, and an analysis and synthesis of this data takes place. The output of this comprehensive process results in the composition of the final study report [\n16\n].\n  3.4. Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria\nThe search strategy of the SLR included the selection of the data sources and the formation of the search criteria. It was meant to be kept as simple as possible, in order to narrow down the results as well as keep the resulting output as relevant as possible. The search was performed against the Scopus database, as it is the most comprehensive source of information in the field of the present research, referencing the main volume of published material.\nThe selection criteria involve careful consideration of specific factors such as relevance to the scope of the present SLR, ensuring that the chosen papers explicitly discuss or investigate the convergence of CTI with blockchain and publication recency bounded to the specified period of 5 years to maintain a contemporary focus. In addition, clarity, coherence, and methodological rigor were taken into strong consideration.\nOn the other hand, exclusion criteria were applied to ensure the selection of impactful research. Sources lacking clear contributions to the understanding of CTI and blockchain convergence were excluded to prioritize substantive insights. Further refinement was achieved by excluding papers with limited accessibility, ensuring that our review comprises readily available and accessible research. Irrelevant publications, not directly addressing the convergence of CTI with blockchain, were also excluded to streamline the focus of our study and enhance the relevance of the selected literature.\nThe search string was the following:\nTITLE-ABS-KEY\u00a0(cyber\u00a0AND\u00a0threat\u00a0AND\u00a0intelligence\u00a0AND\u00a0blockchain)\nThe search criteria were based on the English language and there were no exclusions since the intent was to gather first all the relevant output and then screen the content on a manual basis for more accuracy.\n  4. Results and Categorization\n  4.1. Output and Selection of Publications\nBased on the search criteria applied in October 2023, a total of 158 research publications were retrieved from the Scopus database. During the initial screening process, 79 publications passed as being within the margins of the research scope and 79 were filtered out. The excluded papers, at this stage, were as follows:\n31 papers as literature reviews not in the scope of our research;\n25 publications as lecture notes and book chapters;\n21 papers found out of scope;\n1 paper in duplication;\n1 paper published in a non-English language.\nDuring the next stage, the 79 initially accepted papers were further manually full-text screened, and the following 32 papers were found to be further excluded:\n10 papers not related to CTI;\n13 found to have a general reference to CTI but with no contributing value to the present research;\n9 found to have a general reference to the application of blockchain technology with only a very abstract approach toward CTI.\nAs a result, from the evaluation process, 47 research publications were found to be ultimately accepted for further analysis in the present systematic literature review. The source selection process is shown schematically in . Furthermore, the yearly distribution of the finally included research papers in our systematic review is depicted in , where it is shown that from 2018 onwards, there is an increasing trend in relevant research publications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n      Source selection process from the Scopus database (PRISMA flowchart).\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n      Yearly distribution of research papers included in our systematic review.\n\n\n  \n\n\n  4.2. Categorization Criteria\nThis literature review will follow the approach of categorizing the reviewed papers based on the research questions addressed in \nSection 3\n. This means that the categorization will focus on the aspects shown in  and detailed below.\n\n\nTable 2.\n\n    Categorization criteria.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.2.1. CTI Lifecycle Stages\nThe CTI lifecycle is a systematic and iterative process designed to enhance an organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture by providing timely and relevant information about potential threats. This lifecycle involves several stages, for which various perspectives can be found in the literature [\n3\n,\n12\n,\n17\n]. In the context of this research, the model referred to in [\n12\n] was selected, comprising four stages: direction, collection, processing, and dissemination. This approach stems from the need for simplicity and a focus on presenting a higher-level overview. Recognizing the complexity inherent in more detailed models, the choice was made to streamline and facilitate a clearer understanding at a broader level.\n  4.2.2. CTI Level\nCTI operates on various levels to provide comprehensive insights into the evolving threat landscape [\n18\n,\n19\n]. At the \nstrategic\n level, it provides organizational leaders with a high-level understanding of cyber threats and their potential implications. \nOperational\n CTI provides real-time, actionable intelligence for immediate defensive actions and incident response. \nTactical\n CTI delves into specific threats, offering details on indicators and adversary tactics, aiding in preparation and understanding. Adding a technical layer, \ntechnical\n CTI furnishes granular details on cyber threats, enabling cybersecurity professionals to implement precise and effective countermeasures. These levels collectively equip organizations to navigate and defend against cyber threats across strategic, operational, tactical, and technical dimensions [\n20\n].\n  4.2.3. Research Focus\nTrust, privacy, reputation, quality, sustainability, performance, and scalability are integral aspects of CTI [\n21\n,\n22\n]. \nTrust\n is crucial in information sharing to ensure the reliability of intelligence sources and collaborative efforts. \nPrivacy\n considerations safeguard sensitive data involved in CTI processes, promoting responsible information handling. \nReputation\n and \nquality\n measures are essential to assess the reliability and accuracy of threat intelligence sources, influencing decision-making. \nSustainability\n is vital for ensuring the longevity and relevance of CTI frameworks amid evolving cyber landscapes. \nPerformance\n considerations, including speed and efficiency, are paramount for timely threat detection and response. Lastly, \nscalability\n ensures that CTI systems can adapt to growing volumes of data and emerging threats, maintaining effectiveness over time.\n  4.2.4. Supporting Technology\nThe integration of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, deep learning, and federated learning algorithms, into blockchains [\n23\n] in combination with the usage of consensus algorithms and smart contracts, significantly advances CTI [\n4\n,\n19\n,\n24\n,\n25\n]. AI empowers CTI systems to autonomously analyze massive datasets, identify patterns, and discover complex threat behaviors, enhancing the precision and efficiency of threat detection. Federated learning introduces a collaborative dimension, enabling organizations to pool insights without compromising data privacy, thereby enhancing the collective defense against evolving threats.\nConsensus algorithms ensure the integrity of information in a distributed CTI network, fostering trust among participants by validating and securing shared intelligence. Smart contracts, implemented using blockchain technology, facilitate secure and automated execution of agreements in CTI processes, ensuring transparency, trust, and the seamless enforcement of predefined rules. The amalgamation of these technologies and features fortifies CTI capabilities, providing a dynamic and adaptive framework for organizations to proactively address the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.\nIn addition, the incorporation of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) complements this integrated approach by offering decentralized and content-addressable file storage. IPFS contributes to the scalability and resilience of CTI ecosystems, allowing for efficient and secure off-chain storage of large files and data. This aligns with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, enhancing the reliability and accessibility of critical threat intelligence information across the network.\n  4.2.5. Blockchain Type\nPermissioned/permissionless and public/private blockchains represent distinct models within the blockchain ecosystem [\n26\n]. In a permissioned blockchain, access to the network and participation in the consensus process is restricted to a predefined set of entities, often known and trusted participants. This model is suitable for applications where a higher level of control, privacy, and regulatory compliance is required. On the other hand, permissionless blockchains operate on an open-access principle, allowing anyone to join the network, participate in consensus, and validate transactions without requiring explicit permission. Public blockchains, whether permissioned or permissionless, are accessible to anyone, fostering full decentralization. In contrast, private blockchains limit access to a specific group of participants, offering enhanced privacy and control over the network. Each model applies to different use cases, balancing factors like transparency, decentralization, access control, and regulatory compliance based on the specific requirements of the application or industry.\n  4.2.6. Implementation Maturity\nEvaluating the implementation maturity of a research paper in a technical domain involves employing frameworks such as the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) [\n27\n]. TRL, a scale ranging from 1 to 9, assesses the progression of a technology or solution from basic principles (TRL1) to proven success in operational environments (TRL9). This framework is widely adopted across industries for its structured approach to gauging the readiness of a proposed solution. In the present literature review, this approach will be used to assess the implementation maturity of the scoped research papers, considering experimental validation, scalability, integration with existing technologies, and real-world applicability. However, this assessment will not take place on a comprehensive basis, as a detailed assessment is not one of the objectives of this review.\n  5. Literature Review\nThe research papers that were finally scoped under the present literature systematic review are summarized in , illustrating their contributions based on the defined categorization criteria of the review. The table reveals that these research papers span various criteria, indicating a multifaceted nature in their focus and content. This observation underscores the complexity and diversity of the contributions, making it challenging to neatly classify them into discrete categories. The research papers often address multiple aspects, showcasing a detailed and comprehensive exploration of the common denominator of the review, which is blockchain technology. This complexity highlights the richness and interdisciplinary nature of the literature, emphasizing the need for a holistic understanding of the research landscape within the scope of this review.\nIn the subsequent parts of this section, the focus will be on providing a summary of the various research papers considered within this review, organized based on the proposed types of blockchain technology. This summary aims to distill and highlight the key findings, methodologies, and insights presented in these papers while emphasizing their contributions within the specific contexts of private, public, or consortium blockchain technologies. This categorization allows for a more structured presentation of the literature, offering insights into how different blockchain implementations influence the convergence of CTI and blockchain technology. Despite the diverse nature of the contributions, categorizing them based on blockchain types provides a perspective on the various ways researchers have explored the intersection of CTI and blockchain within distinct blockchain frameworks. This approach enhances the clarity of understanding and enables readers to identify trends and patterns specific to each type of blockchain technology, contributing to a more insightful comprehension of the research landscape within the scope of this review.\nThe selection of blockchain types plays a pivotal role in shaping the trust and privacy dynamics within CTI and blockchain convergence. Different configurations, whether public, private, or consortium, introduce distinct considerations that shape the collaborative CTI sharing landscape. From a security perspective, the choice of blockchain type directly impacts the level of control and access within the network, influencing the confidentiality and integrity of shared threat intelligence data. Understanding the implications of these technological choices is imperative in establishing robust trust mechanisms and ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information exchanged within the CTI ecosystem.\nPublic blockchains are decentralized and open to anyone, allowing universal participation, transaction validation, and ledger maintenance. They operate without a central authority, emphasizing transparency and immutability. In contrast, private blockchains are restricted to authorized entities, providing a controlled environment for transactions and data management, offering heightened privacy and control. Consortium blockchains involve a collaborative effort among a predefined group of participants, combining elements of decentralization with restricted access. Each blockchain type serves distinct purposes\u2014public blockchains prioritize openness, private blockchains prioritize control, and consortium blockchains aim for a balance between collaboration and decentralization. The choice among these blockchain models depends on specific use case requirements, reflecting the diverse landscape of blockchain applications.\n  5.1. Public Blockchains\nXuan et al. [\n28\n] have developed a network threat intelligence sharing platform leveraging blockchain technology.

[\n37\n] propose a CTI sharing mechanism based on blockchain, applying game theory principles and smart contracts. Their approach is designed to motivate and promote active participation in CTI sharing, mitigate free-riding behavior among participants, and enhance enthusiasm and efficiency in the sharing process. Moreover, by leveraging blockchain technology, trust among sharing members is increased, while eliminating the need for trusted third parties, and ensuring both security and efficiency in CTI sharing.\nAl-Sharu et al. [\n38\n] introduce a blockchain-based data sharing approach that focuses on safeguarding the privacy of CTI sharing entities while preventing unauthorized sharing and benefiting legitimate sharing parties. It accomplishes this by creating a comprehensive attack chain using encrypted threat intelligence and leveraging the blockchain\u2019s ability to trace back the source of threats in the attack chain. Additionally, smart contracts are employed to automatically send early warning responses to potential attack targets.\n  5.2. Private Blockchains\nGraf et al. [\n39\n] introduce an automated system for classifying and managing incident reports to establish cyber situational awareness. It combines a deep autoencoder neural network for classification with blockchain smart contracts for incident management. The system offers real-time solutions, reducing the need for extensive human involvement in cyber incident analysis, focusing on essential information for prompt mitigation.\nZhang et al. [\n40\n] introduce an approach to enhance the distribution of intrusion rules in a private blockchain environment. The system utilizes management nodes to consolidate new rules into a designated RuleBlock, which is then broadcasted across the entire network.

The research validates the effectiveness of the segmentation strategy, which is implemented through smart contracts and Hyperledger Fabric channels. The emphasis lies in overcoming trust barriers and addressing data privacy concerns inherent in the domain of CTI.\nPurohit et al. [\n60\n,\n61\n] developed the DefenseChain platform, which harnesses blockchain technology to offer threat intelligence sharing capabilities for defending against cyber threats. DefenseChain facilitates attack detection and mitigation through distributed trust principles, allowing domains to share threat intelligence in a federation, using a quality-based approach for detection and mitigation considering factors such as accuracy, suspiciousness score, service time, attack type, and recurrence.\nHuff et al. [\n62\n] propose a distributed ledger to enable the sharing of cybersecurity threat information as a mechanism for non-attributable participation in a threat-sharing community. The participating entities submit monetized threat intelligence data in the form of structured work queries as transactions on the ledger using token-based authentication based on Distributed Anonymous Payment (DAP) schemes in cryptocurrency.

Discussion\nIn our literature review exploring CTI within the realm of blockchain technology, we have gathered statistical insights on trends in supporting technologies, characteristics, and research approaches. While these statistics offer a glimpse into the landscape, it is important to clarify that they serve as supplementary indicators, not the core focus of this review. Our primary aim is to delve into the broader themes and advancements, also providing relevant background information, while using these statistics as indicative markers to enrich the overall understanding of the intersection between CTI and blockchain technology.\nIn summary, the comprehensive analysis across these research questions not only shows evolving themes but also underscores the interdisciplinary and interconnected nature of research in CTI based on distributed ledger technologies. The parallel exploration of multiple aspects within individual papers enriches the depth and breadth of understanding in this evolving and complex field. An analytic depiction of the research papers\u2019 distributions per research question of this study is shown in . The following sections provide a detailed analysis of this review\u2019s results with respect to our initial research questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.\n\n      Distribution of research papers by research question.\n\n\n  \n\n\n  6.1. RQ1: CTI Lifecycle\nIn regard to the research question \u201cCTI Lifecycle\u201d, it is notable that the \ndissemination\n phase prominently takes center stage. A substantial emphasis, represented by 46 papers, underscores the significance attributed to the effective communication and sharing of CTI. This trend aligns with the collaborative nature of blockchain technology, where secure and transparent dissemination of intelligence is paramount. The distributed and tamper-resistant nature of blockchain facilitates the creation of a trust-enhanced environment, ensuring that CTI is shared reliably among participants.\nComplementing the emphasis on dissemination, the \nprocessing\n phase emerges as another focal point within the CTI lifecycle, as evidenced by 24 papers. This observation underscores the importance attached to the analysis and interpretation of intelligence data enabled by blockchain technology. The \nprocessing\n phase assumes a pivotal role in enhancing cyber threat detection and response capabilities, emphasizing the relationship between CTI and blockchain technology. Blockchain\u2019s ability to maintain an immutable ledger, coupled with its decentralized structure, contributes to the integrity and reliability of the processed intelligence data, reinforcing its role in fortifying cybersecurity measures.\nIn contrast, the \ndirection\n and \ncollection\n phases of the CTI lifecycle do not emerge as key focal points within the literature. This observation aligns with our expectations, considering the inherent nature of these phases. \nDirection\n and \ncollection\n involve activities that are often more centralized and unilateral, focusing on the acquisition and orientation of intelligence data. In the collaborative and decentralized paradigm of blockchain technology, these phases may not play as central a role, reflecting the prioritization of shared dissemination and processed analysis in the context of CTI and blockchain convergence.\n  6.2. RQ2: CTI Level\nConcerning the research question \u201cCTI Level\u201d, the analysis of the results sheds light on the distribution of emphasis across different levels, with a predominant focus on the \ntactical\n and \ntechnical\n dimensions. Notably, a substantial number of papers refrain from explicitly referencing a specific CTI level. This observation, coupled with an in-depth exploration of the content of these research works, suggests that these proposals hold applicability across the entire spectrum of CTI levels, spanning from the \nstrategic\n, which addresses broader organizational goals, down to the most \ntechnical\n, which are concerned with specific threat indicators and vulnerabilities.\nThe absence of explicit level references in a significant portion of the literature implies a versatility that transcends the conventional delineations of CTI levels. Rather than being confined to a particular layer, these proposals showcase adaptability and relevance throughout the full scope of CTI operations. This flexibility is particularly noteworthy in the context of blockchain technology, where the collaborative and decentralized nature of the platform lends itself to addressing a broad array of CTI challenges at various operational levels.\nThis diverse coverage not only underscores the adaptability of proposed solutions but also points towards a comprehensive potential for exploration in the integration of CTI and blockchain technology. The holistic coverage across different CTI levels reflects a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted nature of cybersecurity threats and the need for solutions that can address \nstrategic\n, \noperational\n, and \ntechnical\n aspects. It reinforces the notion that the convergence of CTI and blockchain holds promise for providing comprehensive and adaptable solutions that can effectively enhance cybersecurity across a spectrum of organizational requirements and threat landscapes.\n  6.3. RQ3: Research Focus\nIn view of the review findings related to the research question \u201cResearch Focus\u201d, a nuanced landscape emerges within the domain of CTI and blockchain technology convergence. \nTrust\n emerges as a foundational factor steering collaborative efforts. However, it is essential to acknowledge that while trust might be seen as a primary driver in this convergence, \nprivacy\n stands as a critical characteristic that such solutions must effectively address. Rather than being a driving force, privacy assumes a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of CTI and blockchain integration. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger, establishes a foundation of trust by offering transparency and immutability in CTI transactions. The cryptographic principles embedded in blockchain contribute to the confidentiality of shared data, ensuring that participants have control over their information and share only what is necessary.\nMoreover, the application of \nsmart contracts\n within the blockchain framework introduces an automated mechanism for enforcing privacy rules. By encoding the conditions under which specific threat intelligence data are shared, smart contracts provide an enabling approach to privacy that complements the trust-driven nature of CTI and blockchain convergence.\nSelective disclosure mechanisms inherent in blockchain, such as \naccess controls\n, further contribute to privacy considerations, as this is highlighted in [\n46\n,\n58\n,\n64\n,\n67\n,\n72\n]. This feature allows for the controlled sharing of specific threat intelligence data, aligning with the need for granular control over information dissemination. While trust remains a central theme, the emphasis on privacy is crucial in ensuring that sensitive data are shared judiciously and securely.\nAdditionally, the dimension of \nreputation\n plays a pivotal role in enabling trust-based architectures within CTI and blockchain integration [\n32\n,\n33\n,\n41\n,\n65\n,\n74\n]. Reputation mechanisms within the blockchain ecosystem can enhance the reliability of participants and the information they share. This further fortifies the foundation of trust by introducing a reputational aspect that adds an extra layer of assurance to collaborative efforts in the CTI landscape.\nIn addition to trust, reputation, and privacy considerations, the \nquality\n of CTI assumes paramount importance in the overall context of CTI and blockchain integration [\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n,\n41\n,\n43\n,\n60\n,\n61\n]. The effectiveness of collaborative efforts hinges on the accuracy, relevance, and timeliness of the intelligence shared. Ensuring high-quality CTI not only enhances the efficacy of threat detection and response but also reinforces the foundation of trust by promoting a shared understanding of the threat landscape. Along with quality, other significant factors that are increasingly explored are the scalability and performance of the proposed solutions [\n36\n,\n39\n,\n40\n,\n42\n,\n50\n,\n57\n,\n71\n]. Scalability ensures that the system can accommodate a growing volume of CTI transactions effectively. Performance, on the other hand, is vital for timely and reliable processing of CTI data.\nTrust and privacy stand out as predominant themes, with 34 and 29 papers dedicated to these aspects, respectively. The cross-cutting nature of these dimensions is noteworthy, as several papers contribute concurrently to both trust and privacy considerations. This suggests a holistic approach to addressing the fundamental pillars of security and confidentiality within blockchain-based CTI frameworks. In addition, scalability and performance are addressed in nine and six papers respectively, while the enabling factors of reputation and quality are addressed accordingly by five and seven papers, respectively.\n  6.4. RQ4: Supporting Technology\nExamining the findings pertaining to the research question of \u201cSupporting Technology\u201d, a multifaceted landscape emerges. The reviewed papers reflect a diversified approach, with various aspects of supporting technologies concurrently contributing to the overarching framework. Notably, smart contracts exhibit prominence, featured in 22 papers, highlighting their pivotal role in enhancing the security and efficiency of CTI processes. Machine learning, with seven papers, and federated learning, with four papers, underscore the significance of advanced analytics and collaborative learning in enabling threat detection capabilities. The utilization of specific consensus algorithms (six papers) emphasizes the need for establishing trust and integrity in a distributed CTI network. The incorporation of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), addressed in 10 papers, signals a trend toward decentralized and secure storage solutions for large datasets. Moreover, the modest representation of deep learning (three papers) suggests a nascent exploration of more intricate neural network architectures within the intersection of blockchain and CTI. Finally, the aspects of encryption, mostly homomorphic encryption, introduce a critical dimension, emphasizing the role of secure communication and data protection in the fusion of blockchain and CTI.\nThis analysis not only sheds light on the prevalence of various supporting technologies but also underscores the interconnected and interdisciplinary nature of research in this evolving field. Smart contracts stand out as integral components, playing a pivotal role in not only enhancing security but also streamlining the processes of CTI operations. Machine learning, along with federated learning, underscores the critical importance of advanced analytics and collaborative learning, enriching the capabilities of threat detection in real time. Specific consensus algorithms contribute to establishing trust and maintaining integrity within the decentralized networks of CTI and blockchain integration. The adoption of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) reflects a progressive shift towards decentralized and secure storage solutions, crucial for handling the ever-expanding datasets associated with threat intelligence. The modest exploration of deep learning indicates a promising avenue for the development of intricate neural network architectures, potentially advancing the sophistication of threat analysis. Finally, the emphasis on encryption, especially homomorphic encryption, introduces a crucial layer of secure communication and data protection, ensuring the confidentiality, privacy and integrity of shared threat intelligence. Together, these technologies form a robust foundation, enhancing the collaborative, secure, and efficient nature of CTI operations within the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology.\n  6.5. RQ5: Blockchain Type\nIt is also imperative to extend our exploration to the usage of different blockchain types in underpinning trust and privacy within the convergence of CTI and blockchain technology, addressing the research question \u201cBlockchain Type\u201d, with an observation of the dual focus on permissioned, private, or consortium blockchains (in total 30 papers) and permissionless, public blockchains (11 papers). This reflects a dynamic exploration of different blockchain architectures for CTI applications. The subset of six research papers addressing blockchain technology across all types of blockchain, indicating an abstract approach, emphasizing the importance of a flexible and adaptable approach to blockchain solutions in the cybersecurity domain.\nThe choice between permissioned and permissionless blockchains, and further classifications into public, private, or consortium models, significantly influences the trust and privacy dynamics in CTI and blockchain integration. Permissioned blockchains, such as private or consortium blockchains, often offer controlled access, making them conducive to fostering trust among known entities. These models, by design, enable more granular control over participant identity, contributing to a heightened sense of trust in the CTI sharing ecosystem.\nOn the other hand, permissionless blockchains, particularly public models, promote a decentralized approach where participation is open to any entity. While this openness aligns with the principles of transparency, it introduces complexities concerning privacy. Striking a balance between maintaining transparency, a hallmark of trust, and safeguarding sensitive information is a crucial consideration in the context of CTI and blockchain integration.\n  6.6. RQ6: Implementation Maturity\nExpanding the analysis to include the aspects of \u201cImplementation Maturity\u201d, viewed through Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) metrics, adds a layer of insight into the developmental stages of blockchain-based CTI implementations. The distribution across TRLs reveals a notable emphasis on early-to-mid-stages of maturity, with 5 papers falling within TRL 1-2, 22 papers within TRL 2-3, and 18 papers within TRL 3-4. Additionally, there is a modest representation in the more advanced stages, specifically TRL 5-6, with two papers. It is crucial to highlight that the TRL assessment was not conducted systematically and in depth, serving as a broad indicator rather than an exhaustive analysis. This suggests a need for more comprehensive evaluations in future research to provide a thorough understanding of the maturity trajectories in blockchain-based CTI implementations. The presence of papers across various TRLs hints at an evolving landscape, signaling potential advancements in maturity levels as the field continues to progress.\n  7. Study Limitations\nThis systematic review carries certain limitations, primarily tied to the maturity of existing publications and the specific search engine employed for publication retrieval. Our reliance on Scopus, a robust scientific literature indexing system encompassing major digital libraries like Elsevier, Springer, ACM, IEEE, and MDPI, was our choice to ensure a comprehensive coverage of scholarly work. However, it is important to acknowledge that this decision inherently limits the review to the maturity and depth of publications available within the selected databases.\nFurthermore, the scope of our study focused solely on the scientific literature, excluding the exploration of the gray literature and real-world implementations. This deliberate exclusion was a decision made in alignment with the study\u2019s overarching objectives, emphasizing only a thorough examination of scholarly contributions and insights. While this approach ensures a rigorous analysis of theoretical and academic perspectives, it may overlook valuable insights and experiences found in the gray literature or practical, real-world scenarios. It is essential for readers to be mindful of these constraints when interpreting the findings, recognizing that the study\u2019s design reflects a deliberate choice in pursuit of specific research goals.\n  8.

The reviewed literature primarily focuses on recent advancements and emerging trends, and the rapidly evolving nature of both CTI and blockchain technology may introduce variability over time. Additionally, the diverse methodologies employed across the reviewed papers could contribute to variations in results and interpretations.\nAnother consideration is the potential publication bias within the literature review. The inclusion of published papers may lead to an overemphasis on positive results or successful implementations, potentially neglecting negative outcomes or unsuccessful applications of CTI and blockchain convergence. Addressing this bias ensures a more balanced representation of the field.\nMoreover, the evolving landscape of blockchain technology and the diverse use cases within CTI introduce complexities that might not be fully captured in the current literature. As these technologies continue to advance, new developments may challenge the relevance and completeness of our findings.\nTo mitigate the potential threat related to generalization, future research efforts should consider incorporating longitudinal studies that track the evolution of CTI and blockchain technology over time, using the presented research questions or even an evolution of them. This approach would enable a more comprehensive understanding of trends and variations through the progress of time, offering insights into the persistence or transformation of the research field.\nTo address potential publication bias, researchers can actively seek out and include implementation results, white papers, study cases, and even negative results. This inclusive approach ensures a more accurate and unbiased portrayal of the challenges and limitations associated with the convergence of CTI and blockchain. Moreover, researchers can synthesize results across studies while accounting for methodological variations. This method enhances the robustness of conclusions by identifying patterns and trends that transcend individual study nuances.\nConsidering the evolving landscape of blockchain technology and the dynamic nature of CTI, researchers should establish a framework for continuous monitoring and updates. Regularly revisiting the recent literature, while incorporating the latest developments, ensures that the findings remain relevant and reflective of the current state of the field.\n  9.
