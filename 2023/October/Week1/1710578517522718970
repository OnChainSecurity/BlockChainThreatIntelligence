During the call\nof the 0xe9ccf3a3 function, the attacker reentered and called the 0x5632b2e4\nfunction, setting a block height. Then, in the sellShares function, this\nheight was used as a parameter to calculate the amount of\n[$AVAX] to send, resulting in an\nabnormally large calculated amount. Ultimately, the attacker was able to\nobtain a large profit."
