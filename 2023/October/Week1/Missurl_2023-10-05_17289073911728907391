        "original_content": "Key Takeaways\n\n\nBlockchain technology company Ripple on Thursday announced a plan to issue a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks.\nStablecoins operate at the center of the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, and this new stablecoin issuance is intended to attract new users and liquidity to XRP Ledger.\nCurrently, Tether USD is by far the largest stablecoin when measured by market capitalization, with more than $100 billion worth of tokens in circulation.\n\n\n Blockchain technology company Ripple said Thursday that it plans to launch a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin in an effort to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance and to generate more uses and liquidity for the XRP Ledger blockchain.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ripple's new \nstablecoin\n will be issued on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks at first, and the main goal is to drive more \nliquidity\n, developers, and users to XRP Ledger, which is the native blockchain of the digital asset \nXRP\n. It joins the growing stablecoin market, in which crypto tokens are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and are backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasurys, and other \ncash equivalents\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n The Ripple stablecoin is also expected to be launched on additional blockchains over time. \u201cThis is a natural step for \nRipple\n to continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto,\u201d Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n Ripple continues to deal with a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the \nlegal classification of XRP as a security\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n DeFi Is Built on Stablecoins \n \n\n\n As a massive holder of XRP, Ripple has an incentive to bring more financial activity to XRP Ledger.\n2\n And it's no secret that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is mostly built on stablecoins on various \nblockchains\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n For example, six of the top 10 trading pairs ranked by seven-day trading volume on the version of DeFi exchange Uniswap that exists on Ethereum involved at least one stablecoin as of Thursday.\n3\n Additionally, three of the top five borrowed assets on the Ethereum version of open-source liquidity protocol \nAave\n are stablecoins.\n4\n\n\n\n\n Wrapped Bitcoin, which is a token backed by \nBitcoin\n that's held by digital asset custody provider BitGo in a manner similar to a stablecoin, is also a top asset used in these DeFi apps.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Way To Attract More Users to XRP Ledger \n \n\n\n With so much concentration of DeFi activity in stablecoins, Ripple said it sees the issuance of its own stablecoin as a way to attract users to the XRP Ledger ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cThe XRP Ledger\u2019s native capabilities, including a decentralized exchange and automated market maker, were built to utilize XRP as the bridge asset,\" Ripple President Monica Long said. \"Bringing a trusted stablecoin onto XRPL will drive more adoption and development, contributing to a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTether (USDT)\n is the current juggernaut of the stablecoin market, with a total value of just over $106 billion in circulation on various blockchains as of Thursday, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n6\n The only other noteworthy stablecoin offering in terms of size is USD Coin, which had a total market cap of just under $33 billion as of Thursday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest In Real Estate With The Fundrise Flagship Fund\n\n\n\n    Looking for a way to\n    \nadd real estate to your portfolio?\n\n    Discover the potential of the\n    \nFundrise Flagship Fund:\n\n    A robust $1.3 billion real estate portfolio, ranked among the largest 25 global interval funds.
