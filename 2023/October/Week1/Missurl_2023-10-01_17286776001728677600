        "original_content": "MetaMask Security Alerts is now the default transaction feature for Extension and Mobile users across multiple networks. We collaborated with Blockaid on making this feature unique by adding a level of privacy so that \nthe transaction is never shared with third parties\n when offering necessary scam alerts.\n\n\nWe \nlaunched\n the security alerts in October 2023 under \u201cExperimental\u201d settings for Extension users on Ethereum only. After a successful period, we\u2019re excited to roll this out as default across more networks to Mobile and Extension users for a safer transacting experience. We anticipate this integration will save assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone.\n\n\n\n\n \nSource: \nBlockaid\n \n\n\nWhat networks are supported?\n\n\nMake sure your Extension and Mobile apps are updated to the latest version (v11.10 and v7.17 respectively) to enjoy security coverage across these networks:\n\n\n\n\nEthereum\n\n\nLinea\n\n\nBNB chain\n\n\nPolygon\n\n\nArbitrum\n\n\nOptimism\n\n\nAvalanche\n\n\nBase\n\n\nopBNB (mobile only)\n\n\n\n\nIncreased user adoption = increased security measures\n\n\nWe witnessed a surge of people installing and using MetaMask in the last quarter. From September 2023 until January 2024, MetaMask's Monthly Active Users surged by +55%, signifying a crucial phase for web3.\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s a promising sign of growing web3 adoption, we need to ensure that our users are equipped to keep journeying through this burgeoning crypto space because the scammers don\u2019t sleep.\n\n\nSince December alone we\u2019ve seen many high profile attacks in the industry. During the Ledger Connect Kit incident, nearly 100 frontend dapps were compromised yet \nevery MetaMask user who opted into the \nBlockaid\n security alerts was 100% protected, preventing ~$1.15M worth of assets from being stolen.\n\n\nUnintended transaction outcomes (like unwittingly approving a transaction from a phisher that drains your wallet) remain one of the top fund loss incidents reported by our users. We hope implementing these security alerts helps safeguard you from diverse attack vectors.\n\n\nAdditional ways to practice good security hygiene\n\n\nSelf-custody is a big responsibility. Since you\u2019re ultimately in charge of your account, you\u2019re the only one who can manage dapp permissions and sign transactions. Stay \ninformed\n and vigilant against scammers!\n\n\nWhile we can implement all the tools in the world to try and keep you as safe as possible (which we are), good security hygiene is paramount to navigating this (sometimes scary) maze.\n\n\n\n\nWe have a dedicated team at MetaMask who keep up with the latest attack vectors and publish \nsecurity reports\n each month. Read them for a deeper dive and to know what to look out for.\n\n\nInstall Security Snaps! Your wallet can never have too many shields. Browse and install community-built features \nhere\n.\n\n\nEducate your friends getting into web3. \nMetaMask Learn\n provides a good high-level overview of the basics, and puts them to the test with this \ninteractive security lesson\n. Build better habits together.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a developer, learn how open source tool LavaMoat offers triple-point \nprotection\n in the software development cycle and \nadd it to your build system\n in just 1 hour to defend your app from an attack.\n\n\n\n\nJust last year, \nover $1.7 billion\n of crypto was stolen. Don\u2019t be part of a stat this year. Remember, \nwhen in doubt, just don\u2019t interact.\n\n\nEstablishing new security standards\n\n\nA 2023 survey conducted by Morning Consult for Consensys revealed that 76% of participants prioritize security when selecting a wallet. Just as the transition from HTTP to HTTPS introduced a security standard that protected users and built trust in the internet, the web3 ecosystem needs similar protective measures tailored to our unique environment. This involves tools and protocols that alert users to potential security risks associated with certain dapps\u2014Blockaid\u2019s research finds that 1 in 10 dapps are malicious\u2014ensuring that only secure and verified transactions take place.\n\n\nFor web3 to move beyond this interesting corner of the internet and become mainstream, users need to feel confident that their assets and data are secure. Help us improve this feature by \nreporting false positives\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new transaction experience! Stay safe out there."
