We\u2019re pleased to\nlearn that CoinW\u2019s recent transactions were part of routine cold wallet\nmaintenance. However, we must point out that a lack of prompt communication\nfrom CoinW did heighten concerns. In an industry where trust and security are\nparamount, timely and transparent communication can make all the difference.\nWe\u2019ll continue to act as vigilant guardians, aiming to keep assets and trust\nsecure in the crypto space!"
