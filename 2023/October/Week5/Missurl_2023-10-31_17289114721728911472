        "original_content": "Key Points \nIn Part 1 of this Year-in-Review, we explain why Ronin is the fastest growing blockchain by real users in the world. The seeds we planted in 2023 have begun to bear fruit: over 10x growth in Daily Active Users and RON market capitalization. 1.2M new Ronin addresses over the past year. Pixels became Web3\u2019s second breakout IP after Axie Infinity and now calls Ronin home.\nIn Part 2, we describe how we laid the foundation for hypergrowth on Ronin by reinforcing our infrastructure throughout the year. The upgrade to DPoS strengthened Ronin\u2019s security and further decentralized our network. Mavis Market made it possible for creators to launch or migrate their NFT collections onto Ronin. Ronin Name Service (RNS) and the Ronin wallet will make it easier to onboard the next billion Web3 gamers.\nIn Part 3, we summarize what worked in 2023 and share a sneak-peek at 2024. Spoiler alert: we\u2019re just getting started.\nThe holidays are here, and we\u2019re days away from stepping into a new year. What better time to look back on the past twelve months together? Welcome to Ronin\u2019s year-in-review. We entered 2023 with a monumental task: transforming Ronin into the best place to build and grow Web3 games. \n2023 was the dawn of Ronin \u2013 a scorching sunrise lies on the horizon.\n We\u2019ve pushed through fire and flames to get here \u2013 and it feels like we\u2019re just getting started. This article will cover everything that happened since January: the alliances forged with game studios, the reinforcement of Ronin through DPoS, the exponential growth in real on-chain users, the upgrades to various Ronin and Axie products, and the foundation we\u2019ve laid for 2024.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, so consider this quote from our co-founder Jeffrey \u201cJiho\u201d Zirlin before we begin:\u00a0\n\n\nOn that note, we suggest reading this with a cup of coffee. Or tea.\nPart 1: The Fastest Growing Gaming Blockchain in the World\n\u201cThe fastest growing gaming blockchain in the world\u201d \u2013 bold words, but true.\nSource: Nansen\nOn January 1st 2023, Ronin had about 12K daily active addresses (DAA). Today, that number is well over 200K. \nThat\u2019s more than 16x growth.\nSource: Coingecko\nEarlier this year, the RON market cap was ~40M USD. Anyone who was around back then also remembers that Axie was the only game available. Compare that with today: RON\u2019s market cap has surged past 500M, which represents over 12x growth\n.\u00a0\nSource: Token Terminal\nRonin\u2019s Monthly Active Addresses also surpassed 1.24M in 2023 \u2013 a 707% increase year-over-year. More real users.\nSource: Defi Llama\nLast but not least, Total Value Locked has grown from $48M to over $145M over the same time. These are the fruits of our 2023 labors, and we\u2019ve seen many new games launch on Ronin along the way.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how we made it happen:\nThe Ronin ecosystem today\nInfinite Games: Built on Ronin\nSince 2021, we\u2019ve been on a mission to spread digital property rights to users of the internet \u2013 starting with gamers. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve curated partnerships with game studios who align with our vision. Over ten game studios have joined our movement within the past year, and more are coming soon. A few of these builders have even experienced the Ronin Effect already: a phenomenon that occurs when a Web3 game or NFT collection sees massive growth after migrating or launching on Ronin. For example, Pixels saw its DAU surge beyond 100K while Apeiron watched its daily transactions roar past 5K. These are glimpses of the future we\u2019re building. Let\u2019s look at Pixels and the Ronin Effect\nPixels and the Ronin Effect\nGame genre: social farming simulation MMO (think Stardew Valley or Habbo Hotel)\nMigration date:\n October 31st, 2023\nNFT collections:\n Pixels Pets, 315K+ RON in volume so far\nRonin Effect:\n Pixels DAU surged past 100K after migrating to Ronin. Players also spent ~190K RON buying Pixels VIP passes within the first week after migration. These are real, paying customers generating revenue for Pixels.\nPixels DAU on Wednesday, November 15th \u2013 one week after migrating to Ronin\nEvery movement starts with a group of passionate people \u2013 and this is even more true in gaming. Stans. Power users. Superfans. These players will be the first to playtest a new feature, and the most committed online marketers in any community. Through Axie, we learned the importance of finding and nurturing these superfans into a self-sustaining engine. \nThat\u2019s the secret behind the Ronin Effect.\nPixels is Web3\u2019s second breakout game after Axie Infinity. They\u2019re a scrappy, experimental team that leans into blockchain gaming. Their success is great for the Ronin movement, and even more important for Web3 gaming as a whole. Axie Infinity was a card-battler, while Pixels is a social farming simulation MMO. Both games reached a ceiling on Ethereum, and Ronin took them to the next level. This is the reason we curate our partnerships on Ronin: \nit\u2019s not the genre of the game. It\u2019s the builders and the blockchain they chose.\nHow to Get Started with Pixels\nStep 1: \nGo to \nhttps://play.pixels.xyz/\nStep 2: \nChoose to log-in or sign-up via Ronin Wallet, email address, or phone number\nStep 3: \nComplete the tutorial with Barney the farmer to earn 10 $BERRY and 6 popberry seeds\nStep 4: \nEnter Terravilla and start playing Pixels!\nIn Terra Villa, players can walk around in a free, randomized avatar or wear their own integrated NFTs. Short and stubby CrypToadz, tall and lanky Bored Apes, big and puffy Pudgy Penguins\u2026 All are welcome! Connect your wallet, chat with your friends, and change your appearance any time. Check out the list of current NFT collections already integrated in Pixels, or submit an application to bring your NFT collection to life in Terra Villa using their Typeform. Players can also change their username for 1,000 $BERRY.\nYou may also want to get a plot of Farm Land once you\u2019ve explored Terra Villa and powered through a few tutorial-style Quests. Acquire a small, non-NFT Speck Land with $BERRY earned in-game, rent an NFT Farm Land from another player, or buy your own plot on Opensea. Of course, these Land Plots will be available on Mavis Market once Pixels\u2019 migration is 100% complete.\nMore Games on Ronin\nPixels is one of many games on Ronin today. We\u2019ve welcomed \nApeiron\n, \nZOIDS WILD ARENA\n, and \nWild Forest\n to our movement over the past few months alone. \nThe Machines Arena\n, \nAxie Champions\n, \nBowled.io\n, \nBattle Bears\n, and \nTribesters: Island of Solas\n came aboard in March of 2023. Among these games, players explore everything from real-time strategy (RTS) and match 3 Puzzles to trading card games (TCG), a roguelite x god game hybrid, and team-based shooters.\u00a0\nCalling all Game Developers \u2013 Let\u2019s Build Together\nRonin is the frontier for game developers. We\u2019re also home to the two largest breakout IPs in Web3. We know what it takes to make blockchain gaming work, and would love to connect with more developers interested in joining our movement. Fast transaction speeds. Minimal fees. A vibrant community of passionate Web3 gamers. These already exist on Ronin. If you're aiming to build, grow, and monetize your game, Ronin is the place to be. Connect with us through the form below and let's shape gaming history together.\nVIDEO\nPart 2: Gaming Infrastructure for Real Users\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve built and reinforced infrastructure to prepare for the next wave of Web3 gamers \u2013 whenever it comes. Our upgrade to DPoS in March opened the door to a more decentralized ecosystem, and each product release throughout the year compounded atop this foundation. We also forged alliances with new partners to provide Web3 tooling for developers, gamers, and regular users. \nRonin is getting ready to onboard the next billion Web3 gamers.\u00a0\nThe Upgrade to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)\nIn March, we upgraded the Ronin consensus mechanism from Proof of Authority (PoA) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). The reason behind this decision was simple: a more decentralized network is a stronger one, and it opens the door for more builders to contribute to our ecosystem. It also made it possible for users to stake their RON for the first time. We\u2019ve since distributed about 21M RON in rewards to stakers. Google, Animoca Brands, Nansen, DappRadar, and others all contribute to the security of the Ronin network as Governing Validators while a variety of community members have since become Standard Validators. \nRonin is secure.\n In total, there are 22 validators and ~20K delegators securing Ronin today with over 170M staked in total so far \u2013 which is about 60% of the circulating supply.\nThe upgrade to DPoS ushered in a new era for Ronin. At the start of the year, Axie Infinity was the only game available to play. Today, players have a lot to explore between games from our curated partners and games built by the Axie community. There\u2019s more: third-party, non-gaming services now exist to help users borrow or lend against their Ronin assets, create on-chain gaming identities, query the blockchain without rate-limiting, and more. Builders also have access to new tools like lightning-fast price feeds, gamified social campaign builders, token launchpads, and more. \nOur ecosystem grows stronger everyday.\n We laid these bricks throughout 2023 \u2013 starting with the upgrade to DPoS. What will the Ronin fortress look like in 2024?\nMavis Market: Ronin\u2019s First Generalized NFT Marketplace\nIn May, we launched Mavis Market. Mavis Market is more than Ronin\u2019s first generalized NFT marketplace: it\u2019s where the next wave of NFT \ncreators\n will launch or migrate their collections. The CyberKongz were the first to jump in, and their Genkai public mint confirmed what we already knew: \nMavis Market works for everyone.\u00a0\nTheirs was the first non-Axie NFT collection to set foot on Ronin and it minted out within the first hour. All 3,000 Genkai NFTs found homes with over a thousand unique owners at the price of 0.25ETH each. 200K total RON volume. $1.4M USD in revenue. 2x DAU in a week. The Ronin blockchain processed 1.5K transactions within the first three minutes that day. Many called it the Smoothest Mint of All Time.\u00a0\nThis was a big win for us because we took a contrarian approach to Mavis Market\u2019s royalty structure. As a result, we now offer builders something that no one else can: \nguaranteed creator royalties\n on a marketplace with tons of real-users.\nRoyalties and Aligned Incentives on Mavis Market\nWe designed the Mavis Marketplace Fee Structure to align incentives between creators, Sky Mavis, and the Ronin network. Creators can set their own fee percentages for their work, the Ronin Treasury receives a .5% fee, while Sky Mavis receives a 2% fixed fee for building and maintaining the marketplace. These splits allow us to develop the best marketplace possible for as many users as possible.\u00a0\nThis also makes Ronin the first blockchain that receives a portion of an NFT marketplace fee: it\u2019s the equivalent of an NFT marketplace on Ethereum giving a portion of its fee to Ethereum itself! RON now accrues value from:\nUtility as payment for gas\nStaking rewards\nOwnership of Katana dex\u2019s .05% fee\nMavis Market\u2019s .5% fees\n30% of Ronin Name Service (RNS) fees\n\u2026and more. Soon.\nVIDEO\nBlockchains need human-readable addresses to onboard legions of non-technical users. For example, try saying ronin:41d8cf42236be14cc7b0c0df519a95822d7ad423 ten times fast. It\u2019s too much to ask! That\u2019s why we launched RNS in November: turn long, complicated strings of numbers and letters into memorable gamertags. The Ronin team modeled RNS on Ethereum\u2019s Name Service \u2013 ENS. However, we made a few updates and introduced an anti-squatting fee. This fee gives users a better chance to acquire the name of their choice.\u00a0\nThere were 20K RNS gamertags forged within the first month of the RNS Public Sale. This generated about 160K RON in revenue, 30% of which went to the Ronin Treasury. We also gave our partners and select community members the opportunity to secure their RNS names before the Public Sale to reduce impersonation attempts. Today, anyone can create an RNS name or trade one on Mavis Market. RNS is a pillar of onboarding because the next billion users will look for a way to express themselves when they join our movement \u2013 and we\u2019ll be ready when they do.\nThe Ronin Wallet\nToday, the dawn of Ronin is on the horizon. The pieces are in place, and the next phase of our voyage is about to begin. Over the past year, we\u2019ve crafted the Ronin wallet to withstand the rigors of the journey ahead.\nThe numbers speak for themselves: more than 1.2 million people created a Ronin wallet address in the past year. \nOur social login feature, the integration with Binance Pay, and the introduction of free swaps to RON have boosted the Ronin\u2019s wallet\u2019s accessibility. These are small but critical features that reshape the user experience. They allow us to offer a more intuitive experience for new users, and there\u2019s more to come.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve only touched on a fraction of what we could discuss. Here\u2019s a complete list of launches. Thanks, Dashred for the inspiration and curation of the list!\nPart 3: What\u2019s next?\n2023 was the dawn of Ronin. We learned what works, and saw the beginnings of hypergrowth. In 2024, we\u2019ll double down on everything we\u2019ve learned and stay true to our scrappy, experimental DNA. More curated partnerships with great games and brands. More infrastructure upgrades from Sky Mavis including Mavis Store \u2013 an online shop for third-party builders. More tools for developers to contribute to our movement. More, more, MOAR.\nHere are a few teasers you can expect in the new year:\nMulti-Party Computation (MPC) Wallet technology to improve gaming and onboarding experiences\nPlans to improve Scalability. We are conducting extensive research on existing scaling solutions and are excited to share where Ronin is headed\nReputation systems to reward the most-committed missionaries in the Ronin movement\nAirdrop programs and partner token launches\nProtocol Upgrades & more Ronin Evolution Proposals (REPs). For example, REP009 proposal generating yield on bridged ETH\nHundreds of thousands of real users connect their Ronin wallets to applications everyday. We\u2019ve earned the trust of our community, and appreciate all of our allies walking beside us on this journey. It\u2019s a sight to behold \u2013 we\u2019ve reached the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to keep up with everything happening on Ronin. Think back to last year, when Daily Active Addresses were at 12K and the RON market cap stood at ~$40M. We\u2019ve since seen exponential growth in 2023, and we\u2019re as hungry as ever.\u00a0\nThank you to the Ronin community for believing in our vision. Every step we\u2019ve taken together brings our destiny that much closer. 2023 was the dawn of Ronin. 2024 is the sunrise.\u00a0\nHappy Holidays & Happy New Year,\nThe Ronin Team"
