Please *Revoke* your allowance if any, to https://etherscan.io/address/0x40aa958dd87fc8305b97f2ba922cddca374bcd7f\"\n\nImage\nSource: PeckShield/X\nAnother blockchain security firm, SlowMist, says the private key of a proxy admin owner may have been leaked, which allowed the attackers to steal from the platform after the DEX proxy contract was upgraded on December 12th.\n\n\"The new implementation contract\u2019s functionality is to directly call the claimTokens function of the DEX contract to transfer tokens. Subsequently, attackers began calling the DEX Proxy to steal tokens. The Proxy Admin Owner upgraded the contract again at 23:53:59 on December 12, 2023, with similar functionality, and continued stealing tokens after the upgrade.\"\n\nOKX says the incident involves a deprecated smart contract. The DEX says it is now conducting a review of the attack.\n\n\"We have taken immediate action to secure all user funds and revoke the contract permissions. We are working with relevant agencies to locate the stolen funds and will reimburse affected users with $370,000. A thorough review is underway to prevent similar incidents.
