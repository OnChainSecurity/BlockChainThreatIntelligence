        "original_content": "Ledger breach possibly affecting whole EVM ecosystem - LineaWallet provider MetaMask was also affected by the incident. Ledger released a patch to resolve the issue but warned users to wait 24 hours before using its connector library again.The attack on Ledger\u2019s connector library may be impacting the whole Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, according to the Linea team, a zero-knowledge rollup by Consensys.\n\nThe hacker targeted the Ledger connector library, which was designed to enable communication between Ledger hardware wallets and various decentralized applications (DApps). Wallet provider MetaMask has also been affected by the security incident.According to a post on X (Twitter), MetaMask deployed an update to fix the issue on its MetaMask Portfolio. \"Please ensure that you have the Blockaid feature turned on in MetaMask Extension before performing any transactions on MetaMask Portfolio,\" the company warned on X.\n\nOther affected protocols include Zapper, SushiSwap, Phantom, Balancer and Revoke.cash. Blockchain security firm CertiK told Cointelegraph that any DApp importing the ledger CDN will automatically execute the drainer code, prompting victims to connect via any wallet they support.\n\nLedger is a popular hardware wallet used by many in the crypto community. Its connector library is a critical component that interfaces between the Ledger hardware and various DApps. This library could affect many EVM users and transactions if compromised.\n\nThe attack was initiated after a former Ledger employee was phished and their NPMJS account was compromised. \"The attacker published a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit (affecting versions 1.1.5, 1.1.6, and 1.1.7). The malicious code used a rogue WalletConnect project to reroute funds to a hacker wallet,\" the company wrote on X.\n\nA fix was released nearly 40 minutes after Ledger discovered the issue. The company is warning users to wait 24 hours before using its Ledger Connect Kit again.Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain claimed the hacker had stolen assets worth nearly $484,000, but the impact of the security breach could be bigger, noted Ledger.\n\n Magazine: 2 years after John McAfee\u2019s death, widow Janice is broke and needs answers"
