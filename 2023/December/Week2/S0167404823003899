To enhance the ability of downstream classifiers to distinguish phishing accounts more effectively, we produce dense representations of Ethereum accounts in latent space, leveraging the transaction network topology and associated statistical features. However, the task of learning representations from sparse yet voluminous transaction records presents a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Temporal-based Sequences Generator (TSG) and the Heterogeneous-based Sequences Generator (HSG). These generators create sequences from the transaction network, optimizing the use of transaction temporal constraints, diverse account types, and transaction amounts. Our method aims to capture latent higher-order information and generate dense vectors using a network embedding technique. Furthermore, we propose a novel Statistics-Based Sampling (SBS) method to mitigate label leakage. We validate our approach through experiments with various classic downstream classifiers, demonstrating that Phish2vec surpasses other comparative methods in performance and exhibits robustness and stability.\n\nIntroduction\nIn 2014, Ethereum whitepaper1 was released, signifying the inception of Blockchain 2.0. Ethereum utilizes Ether (ETH) as its cryptocurrency and provides smart contract functionality. Regrettably, phishing scams aimed at Ethereum have caused substantial financial losses over time, which significantly undermines the credibility of ICO activities. Thus, detecting and preventing phishing accounts in the Ethereum ecosystem have become increasingly important.\n\nIn 2023, a phishing attack specifically targeted the Ethereum Denver conference, resulting in the theft of over $300,000 worth of Ether.2 The perpetrators even went to the extent of paying for a Google advertisement, which boosted the fraudulent website's search result ranking above the legitimate ETHDenver site. A co-founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) collection Moonbirds, fell victim to a phishing scam, resulting in the theft of over $1.1 million worth of his personal NFTs3. These incidents are not isolated, as a study conducted in 2017 revealed that over 80% of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) conducted that year were identified as scams4. Some notable examples include the impersonation of Seele ICO admins, resulting in the loss of nearly $2 million for potential investors5, and the swindling of approximately $1 million from investors participating in Bee Token's ICO6.\n\nMany blockchain practitioners have fallen into the trap of phishing scams, not to mention ordinary people who are confused by phishing scams. Therefore, detecting phishing accounts has become a practical problem with industrial significance. In existing academic research, detecting blockchain phishing scams is abstracted as a classification problem. That is, learning information from explicit features or implicit relationships on the chain, and then discriminating accounts. We mainly focus on starting from the most intuitive insight of Ethereum, innovating in the aspect of topological information mining, and using classic downstream classifiers to judge the quality of transaction topological information mining.\n\nCompared to early blockchain platforms, Ethereum possesses a multitude of unique properties. It supports smart contracts and has two distinct types of accounts, namely Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Contract Accounts (CAs). Additionally, transaction opcodes are recorded in Ethereum transactions, which are relevant to the contract code. Ethereum also shares similarities with other blockchain platforms. The modeling for a transaction is depicted in Fig. 1, where we conceptualize a transaction as an edge within the Ethereum transaction network. We summarize two research challenges (RC) in detecting Ethereum phishing accounts as follows.\n\nRC1: Mining High-order Information from Transaction Network. Firstly, mining high-order information from transaction network is necessary because explicit statistical features heavily rely on data quality and cannot exhaustively capture all the information within the latent space. Secondly, Ethereum accounts are not only associated with conventional statistical features but also have transactional relationships with other accounts. These transactions not only exchange amounts but may also involve contract creation and operations. Thirdly, the temporal order of transactions and the nature of associated accounts also contain important information. Furthermore, positive samples of Ethereum phishing accounts are relatively sparse, making it impractical to directly use the entire transaction network for supervised learning.\n\nRC2: Processing Large and Sparse Data. Firstly, the large volume of Ethereum transaction data not only slows down the model's running speed but may also exceed the memory limit of experimental devices for some graph learning models (as discussed in section 4.3). Secondly, transaction data is also sparse relative to accounts, with 99% of accounts having a degree of less than 40, limiting the information that can be learned from each account.\n\nTo address the aforementioned RCs, existing studies on Ethereum phishing scams predominantly focus on two aspects: the first involves the explicit learning of statistical features to directly distinguish phishing accounts. While these models can accurately represent the current account status, they heavily rely on the quality of statistical features and fail to investigate high-order relationships between accounts. Consequently, a more effective approach currently in use is the implicit extraction of high-order information, typically achieved through graph learning. However, present graph learning techniques may encounter limitations in adequately mining Ethereum-specific features, such as transaction order logic and different account types, leading to sub-optimal results. Specifically, Wu et al. (2022) introduced the Trans2vec method, which is the first to employ the time and amount of Ethereum transactions to guide random walks and execute graph embedding. Nevertheless, this method still overlooks transaction order and the heterogeneity of accounts.\n\nTherefore, we introduce Phish2vec, which not only takes into account the temporal order, amounts, and related account types of Ethereum transactions, but also optimizes the random walk process for large-scale data. This effectively enhances the efficiency of model execution and mitigates the adverse effects of sparsity on model performance. Our primary contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022\nWe propose the Phish2vec approach that leverages both the Temporal-based Sequences Generator (TSG) and Heterogeneous-based Sequences Generator (HSG) to improve the representation learning performance.\n\n\u2022\nWe devise a Statistics-Based Sampling (SBS) method on the transaction network of Ethereum, which mitigates the potential label leakage issue.\n\n\u2022\nIn our experiments, Phish2vec outperforms the comparison methods in three metrics and thus showcases its effectiveness.\n\n\nThe article proceeds by presenting related work on Ethereum phishing scams and their detection in Section 2. In Section 3, the Phish2vec method and its components are elaborated. Section 4 evaluates Phish2vec's performance using three metrics and compares it with other state-of-the-art embedding-based algorithms. Finally, the limitation and future work are discussed in Section 5, and the conclusion of our work is presented in Section 6.\n\nAccess through your organization\nCheck access to the full text by signing in through your organization.\n\nSection snippets\nEthereum phishing accounts detection method\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem expands and downstream applications proliferate, detecting phishing scams has become increasingly challenging.

However, we acknowledge the limitations of this work and plan to conduct further research in the future.\n\nFirstly, a notable limitation is the inability to achieve end-to-end classification. Our research primarily focuses on modeling the topological structure of the\n\nConclusion\nWe presents a novel approach for enhancing the learning of account representations on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically tailored for more effective detection of phishing accounts. Our approach encompasses several key components: data preprocessing, temporal and heterogeneous sequence generation, and neural network-based anomaly detection.
