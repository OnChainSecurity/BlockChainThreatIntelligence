        "original_content": "How to Spot a Rug Pull (7 Signs)Boys, it almost happened. I almost lost it all to a crypto scam. I\u2019ve mentioned this briefly in the video we posted \"What is a Rug Pull?\" but I wanted to dive a little deeper into it.\nBefore we start this story I want you to know we don\u2019t participate in many scams, this was for educational purposes only to understand how degen yield farms really work.The day was March 3rd, and I had just tossed out a few hundred dollars into a degen yield farm to see if it was going to pump and dump. This project looked promising-it had all the characteristics I was looking for:\nlocked liquidity\nthe social media page was blowing up\nthe whitepaper said the problems it was solving\nBut sure enough it was another dredged rug pull. I was lucky enough to get my funds out. I realized as soon as it launched that you couldn\u2019t harvest anything. In fact, the code made it so when you tried to harvest your interest, the harvested tokens were sent to the dev\u2019s wallet address.This might not be a definitive sign but it\u2019s a good start. Have you noticed that all new yield farms have pretty much the same layout? This is because they are easily re-using the original code from the GooseSwap degen yield farm to host their new site.\n\nThis is important because you can tell if something is a scam by the amount of time they took to develop it. For example, did they spend 10 minutes outsourcing some new images or did they spend a couple weeks coming up with a brand new design to host their new company that will help further crypto?\n\nSome platforms take months to build before they launch, while degen yield farms can be set up in minutes. \n\n2) Liquidity\nChecking liquidity is actually only something you can do if you\u2019re investing in a specific token, not an actual project like AAVE or Curve or Dfyn. However, checking the amount of liquidity is a very powerful indicator of how likely a token is to be a scam.For example, any token with $10,000 in liquidity can easily be manipulated to double or triple the price. But also it means the developer doesn\u2019t have much money to invest in the token.\n\nOn the other hand, a token like Uniswap actually has around $34,000,000 in liquidity. If you\u2019re new around here, liquidity refers to the amount of value in tokens that can actually be traded.\n\nCheck out our videos on how a liquidity pool works and what an automated market maker is if you want to be a liquidity expert by only watching two videos.\n\n3) Weird Social Authority\nRemember your favorite influencer telling you that \"honeybee\" or \"cummies\" was the next big project and that if you bought some that they would match it? Well, if you notice large influencers promoting projects that they have no part in, this is another big sign that a rug pull is evident.\n\nEspecially generic A-list celebrities promoting a coin, or especially a token, that isn\u2019t Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most A-list celebrities aren\u2019t going to look into the code of how that coin works, let alone even visit the website and read the whitepaper or roadmap of the project.You don\u2019t let them pick your job, your future stocks, or your romantic partner-so don\u2019t let them pick your coins or tokens either. \n\n4) Whitepaper\nDo you know how when you go to buy a course or product that everything on the sales page has been psychologically vetted to make sure it\u2019s the best to get an emotional buying response out of you?\n\nI know this for a fact because personally I run another Youtube channel that sells courses, and these pages can take months to perfect, but when they do, even I get giddy reading through them. \n\nWell this is the same as a whitepaper. Good projects have solid whitepapers where they\u2019ll give you stats, diagrams, and the problems they are solving. If the whitepaper is less than 20 pages, it\u2019s not a whitepaper, it\u2019s a sales page designed to get you to invest your money. Maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. \n\n5) Looking Deeper into Code \nMoving on, one of the best ways to avoid a rug pull is simply to look at the code of the smart contract or token code.\n\nThere are many ways to do this, but the best is to go to your favorite blockchain explorer and use the contract inspecting tool to\u2026 what the heck am I saying\u2026 this is supposed to be a SIMPLE explanation of how to spot a smart contract. You guys arent going to do all of that. Lucky for you, I\u2019ve got the hookup. First, you want to check out the project on Rug Doctor. They have a website dedicated to actually reviewing the smart contract code and identifying common rug pull techniques. They then use their website rugdoc.io to inform the visitors of these scams. \n\nSecondly, you\u2019ll want to bookmark TokenSniffer.com. Token sniffer is an amazing website that basically compares a ton of tokens and how similar they are. If a token is 80%+ similar to another token\u2026 it\u2019s not unique and that\u2019s a huge red flag for rug pulls. Why create a unique token when you can just copy/paste some code and scam some degens? \n\n6) Check Wallets for Whales Here\u2019s some advice where you might actually use a blockchain explorer. Most explorers for the Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chains will let you look at all the tokens out there.\n\nPop in the token address to the search bar and you can actually see a list of the top token holders who hold that token. If more than 20% of a token is held by 1 wallet, or even if the top 10 wallets hold more than 20% combined, you could be getting rugged.\n\nThe idea here is that one person could sell all their tokens, which is a large majority of all the tokens, and crash the price. This is actually probably the easiest way to spot a rug pull. \n\n7) Total Value Locked\nIn terms of investing in a project and not a specific coin, you can actually check out a metric that is called \"TVL\" or \"total value locked\". TVL is the total dollar amount of coins and tokens invested into the project.\n\nFor example, AAVE, which is a well-known bluechip borrowing and lending platform, has over $20 billion invested in it. A degen yield farm I saw on the subreddit r/CryptoMoonShots that recently launched was around $100,000. $100,000 is still a ton of money, but nothing compares to $20 billion or the $10 billion that Curve Finance has. What to do if you\u2019re in a Rug Pull?\nThe first thing you should do is remove your investment if you notice that it is going to be rug pulled. This can be tricky because some of the rug pull smart contracts locks your assets so you can\u2019t withdraw within 48 hours of their initial opening.\n\nSecondly, you should probably tell everyone else about the rug pull. Maybe you can share via the Discord or Telegram.\n\nThirdly, you should reach out to the Rug Doctor and maybe they can add the token to their list.\n\nConclusion\nSo to summarize in an out-of-order fashion:\n\nInvest in projects that already have a bunch of money in them\nDo your due diligence by checking popular rug pull lists and checking wallets\nJoin a project\u2019s community and ask specific questions about their whitepaper\nReach out to us and we would love to check out a project for free, you can join our Discord for free with this link.\nThanks for reading, we hope you enjoyed it, and we really hope you learned something."
