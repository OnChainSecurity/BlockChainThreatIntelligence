These reports include detailed information about the specific repository that was audited for the project in question. Many of our clients choose to publicly list their audit reports here for added transparency.\nHow does the auditing process work? How do I initiate an audit?\nBegin by requesting an audit and giving us details about your team and project. Someone from our team will reach out to gather any additional information we need, give you a customized quote, and schedule a kickoff meeting. \nDuring this initial phase, we\u2019ll discuss any expected timelines, details or resources we need from you to get started. Following the audit, you'll receive a detailed initial report that outlines our findings and recommendations. This report provides an opportunity for you and your team to address any vulnerabilities listed. Once you've made the necessary fixes, our team will review these and provide an updated, final report.\nHow long does an audit take? How much does it cost?\nThe duration and cost of a smart contract audit can vary significantly based on the size and complexity of your project. Smart contracts can range from a few thousand lines of code to tens of thousands, so it\u2019s impossible to provide a fixed cost without a good understanding of the project scope.\u00a0\nAudit timeline also depends on various factors: codebase length, complexity, documentation quality, and the extent of communication required with our team. Please get in touch with us and we can provide a custom quote based on your unique project\nDo you do audits on multiple chains?\nYes, Quantstamp is blockchain agnostic. We\u2019ve conducted audits on various blockchain networks including Ethereum, Solana, Flow, Cardano, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Near, Hedera Hashgraph, Tezos, Aptos, and Sui. Our expertise also extends to new blockchains and programming languages.\nRequest an Audit\nReady to start? Get in touch with our team to discuss details, cost and timeline.\n\n\n\n"
