As the contract\nis unverified, we suspect that it might be due to potential flaws in the\nreward calculation logic. The contract 0x431abb seems to distribute\n[#FCN] token rewards to users, which are\ncalculated based on the reserve amount of the FCN-BSC-USD pair. The attacker\nfirst staked some tokens. After that, he first flash-loaned BSC-USD from the\npair and then claimed rewards within the flash loan callback. Due to the\ndecreased amount of BSC-USD in the pair, 0x431abb incorrectly calculated the\nreward, leading to an excessive allocation of\n[#FCN] tokens to the attacker.
