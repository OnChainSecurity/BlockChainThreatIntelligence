        "original_content": "Phalcon's debug feature allows you to view internal function calls of a\ncontract and debug them side-by-side with the code, which can be very helpful\nduring analysis. For example, in this attack, when debugging the withdraw(),\nyou can see that the check is whether end_time is greater than or equal to the\ncurrent block.timestamp. By comparing this with the logic of Lock_Token(),\nit's easy to point the root cause. Additionally, it's worth noting that the\ndefault debug code provided by Phalcon shows the function's call_site. In\ncases where the attacked contract is unverified, you can click \"Go To\nLock_Token Implementation\" to view the specific implementation logic, or use\nthe \"Step In\" feature to examine the detailed logic."
