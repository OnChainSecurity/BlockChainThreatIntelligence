If convicted on all counts, the brothers face up to 20 years in prison.\n\n\nThe MIT-educated pair are accused of netting around $25 million worth of tokens in a 12-second span\u2014the duration of a block validation \u2018slot\u2019 on Ethereum\u2014by manipulating vulnerabilities in the process by which Ethereum verifies transactions. Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the \u201cnovel\u201d scheme \u201ccalls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\u201d\n\n\nThe scheme involved Ethereum\u2019s so-called \u2018maximal extractable value\u2019 (MEV), the process by which Ethereum\u2019s transaction validators can preview and reorder pending transactions. MEV allows validators to personally profit from this\u00a0advance\u00a0knowledge by front-running significant or large transactions. European regulators recently\u00a0\nflagged MEV for its potential for market abuse\n.\n\n\nThe DOJ says the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole funds that would otherwise have gone to a group of Ethereum validators using MEV-Boost. This open-source software outsources the creation of new Ethereum blocks to a network of \u2018searchers,\u2019 \u2018builders,\u2019 and \u2018relays.\u2019\n\n\nSearchers utilize automated bots to scan the Ethereum\u00a0mempool\u00a0for profitable arbitrage opportunities, then forward a bundle of preferred transactions to the builder.\u00a0This bundle prioritizes the searcher\u2019s \u2018frontrun\u2019 transaction, aka buying a token\u00a0on\u00a0the expectation that the\u00a0transactions that follow will boost the value of\u00a0said\u00a0token.\u00a0The searcher also includes a \u2018sell\u2019 transaction further back in the bundle to cash out this expected spike in token value.\n\n\nBuilders sent these bundles to a relay, which initially\u00a0submits\u00a0only the blockheader to a validator. Only after the validator\u00a0accepts\u00a0the block for publishing to the chain\u00a0does\u00a0the validator see the complete ordered transaction list.\n\n\nTaking the bait\n\n\nAs detailed in\u00a0\nthe indictment\n, the brothers began plotting their heist around December 2022, just months after Ethereum\u00a0\nmade its transition\n\u00a0from a consensus mechanism based\u00a0around\u00a0\nproof-of-work\n\u00a0(PoW) to one based on\u00a0\nproof-of-stake\n\u00a0(PoS).\n\n\nThe brothers established 16 validators, then engaged in a series of \u2018bait transactions\u2019 to figure out what motivated MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The brothers thus identified three \u2018victim traders\u2019 that specialized in crypto arbitrage trades.\n\n\nThe brothers then initiated \u201cat least eight\u201d transactions (the \u2018Lure transactions\u2019) they knew would cause the victim traders\u2019 MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The bundles also included the victim traders\u2019 own \u2018buy\u2019 transactions in which they paid $25 million in\u00a0\nstablecoins\n and other tokens to acquire \u201csubstantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies\u201d (aka shitcoins of little or no utility).\n\n\nThe victim traders also included their \u2018sell\u2019 transactions after the Lure transactions, but with coded conditions that\u00a0the\u00a0frontrun\u00a0transactions couldn\u2019t be executed\u00a0unless\u00a0the Lure transactions\u00a0\u201ctook place immediately after the\u00a0frontrun\u00a0trades\u201d\u00a0\nand\n\u00a0the sell transactions occurred immediately after the Lure transactions.\n\n\nBut the brothers had identified a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay code that prematurely exposed the full content of proposed blocks. This allowed the brothers to tamper with the victim traders\u2019 proposed blocks when one of the brothers\u2019 16 validators was selected to approve the next block.\n\n\nOnce the victim traders\u2019 $25 million buy transactions had gone through, the brothers \u201creplaced the Lure transactions with Tampered transactions. In the Tampered transactions, the defendants sold the same illiquid cryptocurrencies that the victim traders had recently purchased as a result of the Lure transactions and, for which the defendants already held as a result of information gathered through the bait transactions. In effect, the Tampered Transactions drained the particular liquidity pools of all the cryptocurrency that the Victim Traders had deposited based on their frontrun trades.\u201d\n\n\nThe net result was that the victim traders\u2019 sell orders couldn\u2019t go through, leaving them with worthless\u00a0shitcoins\u00a0while the brothers collected around $25 million in stablecoins and more liquid tokens. The brothers then published the re-ordered block to the Ethereum network.\n\n\nThe victim traders eventually caught on to what had occurred and reached out to the brothers, as did \u201ca representative from Ethereum.\u201d The brothers ignored these pleas and set about laundering their stolen loot through exchanges with minimal \u2018know your customer\u2019 controls\u00a0as well as\u00a0some\u00a0\ndecentralized finance\n\u00a0(DeFi) protocols.\n\n\nWhile the brothers may have graduated from MIT, they failed OpSec 101 by googling phrases such as \u2018money laundering\u2019 and \u2018does the United States extradite to [insert country here]\u2019 ahead of their heist.\n\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the brothers\u2019 high-tech antics \u201cwere no match for DOJ prosecutors and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme.\u201d IRS Criminal Investigation unit special agent Thomas Fattorusso added that his office had \u201csimply followed the money\u201d using \u201ccutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d\n\n\nWhile the company behind MEV-Boost released an update to prevent future exploits of this kind,\u00a0the reputational hit that Ethereum has taken\u00a0since its shift to PoS shows no sign of ending.\u00a0In fact,\u00a0PoS is considered one of the primary reasons why the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is (allegedly) preparing to\u00a0\ndesignate ETH as an unregistered security\n.\n\n\nA significant chunk of ETH\u00a0was already concentrated\u00a0in relatively few hands, most\u00a0of them\u00a0belonging to\u00a0\nEthereum insiders\n who were the primary beneficiaries of 2014\u2019s controversial crowdsale. PoS was guaranteed to \nfurther\u00a0concentrate\u00a0control of the network\n,\u00a0trigging\u00a0more planks of the\u00a0\nHowey test\n. Regulatory blowback was/is inevitable.\n\n\n\u2018Compromised and partially drained\u2019\n\n\nStill more \u2018crypto\u2019 bro-on-bro violence made the news this week courtesy of a hack of the BlockTower blockchain-focused institutional investment firm.\n\n\nOn May 14,\u00a0\nBloomberg\n reported that BlockTower\u2019s\u00a0main\u00a0hedge fund had been \u201ccompromised and partially drained by fraudsters,\u201d citing sources familiar with the situation who didn\u2019t want to\u00a0be identified.\u00a0The total amount of the stolen assets, as well as\u00a0the nature of the hack went unspecified, but BlockTower has reportedly hired blockchain forensics experts to\u00a0get to the bottom of this mess.\n\n\nAs a private company beholden only to its well-heeled investors, BlockTower has so far offered no official statement about the report. The company\u2019s main fund held around $1.7 billion worth of assets under management prior to the hack.\n\n\nThis\u00a0isn\u2019t the first time BlockTower has suffered losses via exploits, having lost $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens after hackers targeted its wallet on the\u00a0Dexibel\u00a0decentralized exchange in 2023.\n\n\nBlockTower describes its Flagship fund\u2019s\u00a0M.O.\u00a0as \u201cfocused on liquid crypto assets via a multi-strategy approach analyzing both top-down market regimes and bottom-up asset selection (beta augmented with alpha),\u00a0and incorporating market neutral strategies where appropriate to the opportunity set.\u201d\n\n\nIn 2022, BlockTower launched a dedicated venture capital fund that has taken stakes in numerous \u2018crypto\u2019 entities, including memecoin-factory\u00a0\nSolana\n, struggling NFT-focused \nDapper Labs\n, Sky Mavis (parent of the\u00a0\nAxie Infinity\n\u00a0game, which suffered a\u00a0\nnine-figure hack\n\u00a0of its Ronin Bridge network in 2022) and fraudulent\u00a0\n\u2018algorithmic stablecoin\u2019\n issuer \nTerraform Labs\n.\n\n\nHonestly,\u00a0given that stellar track record, we\u2019re a little surprised there was anything left to steal.\n\n\nMake it stop\n\n\nBlockTower wasn\u2019t the end of this week\u2019s hackery. The Sonne Finance \u2018decentralized non-custodial lending protocol\u2019 was\u00a0\ntaken for $20 million\n\u00a0worth of \u2018wrapped\u2019 ETH and\u00a0\nUSDC\n tokens. Sonne Finance said\u00a0it\u2019s prepared\u00a0to offer the hacker a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 that would allow him/her/they to keep 10% of their loot as payment for pointing out the gaping security flaws if they return the other 90%.\n\n\nBut\u00a0the hacker has reportedly\u00a0already\u00a0\nswapped some of their ill-gotten gains\n for nearly 1,200 ETH and 183,000 DAI (an Ethereum-based stablecoin maintained by the \nMakerDAO\n decentralized autonomous organization).\u00a0From there, the ETH will almost certainly tread the well-trodden path to\u00a0\nTornado Cash\n, the ETH-based\u00a0\ncoin mixer\n\u00a0that helps obfuscate a digital asset\u2019s digital trail.\n\n\nWe say that with some confidence because on May 14,\u00a0\nReuters\n revealed\u00a0a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee report that found Tornado Cash helped launder $147.5 million worth of ETH that\u00a0was stolen\u00a0from\u00a0\nJustin Sun\n\u2019s HTX (formerly\u00a0\nHuobi\n) exchange last year by North Korea\u2019s hackers.\n\n\nThat nine-figure sum was funneled through Tornado Cash in\u00a0the month of\u00a0March alone. A further $66.3 million worth of ETH\u00a0that was\u00a0stolen from the Sun-linked\u00a0\nPoloniex\n exchange \nhas been similarly washed\n.\u00a0With apologies to ancient Rome, when it comes to stolen tokens, all roads lead to Tornado Cash.\n\n\nThe\u00a0UN\u00a0report,\u00a0based on data provided by PeckShield and Elliptic analysts, also found that North Korea was the likely culprit behind 97 suspected attacks on \u2018crypto\u2019 firms that netted the Hermit Kingdom some $3.6 billion between 2017 and 2024.\u00a0The same report indicates that North Korea may have been responsible for 11 \u2018crypto\u2019 heists\u00a0so far\u00a0this year that netted nearly $55 million.\n\n\nIronically, many of the victims of these heists were likely among the legions of \u2018crypto bros\u2019 loudly denouncing this week\u2019s\u00a0\nsentencing of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev\n to 64 months in a Dutch prison for money laundering. Code is law, after all\u2026 that is, until it\u2019s \nyour\n\u00a0bits of code\u00a0that\u00a0have been stolen and laundered.\u00a0Still, man up and take one for the team, right?\n\n\nOne imagines that, within crypto crook circles, it\u2019s hard to get angry when they get caught thieving from each other. After all, it\u2019s the dominant ethos of this game, in which the much-ballyhooed notion of \u2018building\u2019 doesn\u2019t so much take a backseat to \u2018grifting,\u2019 it gets relegated to a rickety trailer haphazardly hitched to the back of this out-of-control 18-wheeler.\n\n\nFor those of you who crave a more productive,\u00a0utilitarian\u00a0and\u00a0(ta-da!) legally- and regulatory-compliant worldview, there\u2019s\u00a0\na little shindig going on in London\n\u00a0next week that might be\u00a0just\u00a0what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nWatch: Teranode & the Web3 world with edge-to-edge electronic value system\n\n\n\n\n\n"
