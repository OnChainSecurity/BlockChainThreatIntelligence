Thomas\nN1  - Publisher Copyright:\n\u00a9 2023 IEEE.\nPY  - 2023\nY1  - 2023\nN2  - When a blockchain application runs on data from the real world, it relies on an oracle mechanism that transports data from external sources to the blockchain. The blockchain oracle problem arises around the need to procure trustworthy data from external sources. Previous works have addressed data authenticity/integrity by building a secure channel between blockchain and external sources while employing a decentralized oracle network to avoid a single point of failure. However, the truthful data challenge, which emerges when legitimate external sources submit fraudulent or deceitful data, remains unsolved. In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized truth-discovering oracle architecture called DecenTruth to address the truthful data challenge using a data-centric approach. DecenTruth aims to elevate the \"truthfulness\"of external data input by enabling decentralized oracle nodes to discover and reach consensus on truthful values of common data objects from multi-sourced inputs in an off-chain manner. It harmonizes techniques in both the data plane and consensus plane - truth discovery (TD) and asynchronous BFT consensus - and enables nodes to finalize the same estimated truths on data objects with high accuracy, amid the harsh asynchronous network condition and presence of Byzantine sources and nodes. We implemented DecenTruth and evaluated its performance in a simulated oracle service scenario. The results demonstrate significantly higher Byzantine resilience and long-term data feed accuracy of DecenTruth, compared to existing median-based aggregation methods.\nAB  - When a blockchain application runs on data from the real world, it relies on an oracle mechanism that transports data from external sources to the blockchain.
