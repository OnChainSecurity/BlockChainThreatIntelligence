These companies offer a variety of services, including smart contract auditing, security testing and incident response. PureFi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for cryptocurrency onboarding, has introduced a new method called SafeTransact to improve the security of Web3 transactions.\n\nWeb3 security is heavily dependent on the unique ability of blockchains to establish promises and withstand human intervention. These software-controlled networks, however, are a potential hacking target because of the related trait of finality - the fact that transactions are often irreversible. This implies a need for more levels of prevention-oriented security. SafeTransact\u2019s addition to the global crypto security arsenal helps in that regard.\n\nSafeTransact examines blockchain transactions and promptly notifies users of any suspicious activities. It is designed to integrate with AMLSafe, a multi-crypto wallet from the same ecosystem.\n\nThe SafeTransact system considers the token address, sender address, spender address and amount to gauge transaction risk for approved transactions. The system analyzes input data such as \"from,\" \"to\" and \"amount\" addresses to determine risk levels for token transfer transactions. For swap transactions, it analyzes decentralized exchange addresses, fund senders, tokens in and out, and amounts sent to provide a comprehensive assessment of risk.\n\nAccording to a recent Chainalysis report, the DeFi industry experienced the most hacks and data breaches in 2022. The DeFi space is yet to develop security measures to help users navigate the Web3 world.\n\nRelated: No \u2018respite\u2019 for exploits, flash loans or exit scams in 2023: Cybersecurity firm\n\nSecurity companies perform audits of Web3 applications to identify vulnerabilities and potential risks, as well as develop blockchain-specific security tools that can help detect and prevent attacks on blockchain networks. These security companies also implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities in Web3 applications.\n\nOverall, security companies are constantly innovating and developing new approaches to protect Web3 transactions, given the unique challenges and risks associated with blockchain-based transactions.\n\nMagazine: North Korean crypto hacking: Separating fact from fiction\n\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.
