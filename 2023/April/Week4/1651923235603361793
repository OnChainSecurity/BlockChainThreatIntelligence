Basically, the hacker involves a flashloan deposit of\n~24.5m USDC as collateral to borrow 5.4m USDT and 720k USDC. In the meantime,\nit involved a series of leveraged borrow of vGHST, which suffers from a\ndonation-based price manipulate and makes the hacker's borrow position\nliquidatable. The borrow position is then liquidated to take back the original\nUSDC collateral."
