The initial funds came from\n\n[@FixedFloat](/FixedFloat)\n\nand were transferred from BSC->ARB through multichain. Then the final profit\n(~140.5ETH) was bridged from ARB->ETH through multichain and deposited into\nFixedFloat in 4 txns. MetaSleuth noticed that Elleria Bridge Exploiter has a\nspecial liking for FixedFloat. And we found an address 0xfd71 on both BSC and\nARB has an unusual relationship with the exploiter.
