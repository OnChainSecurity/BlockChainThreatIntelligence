It is the role of the validator to process deals and add new blocks to the blockchain, which are the duties of the validator.\n\nAccording to a tweet from former Ethereum Foundation member Hudson Jameson, the assault has the potential to change the MEV ecosystem because MEV extractors will be left wondering \"which Ethereum validators are malicious.\"\n\nBy sending transactions immediately before and after a victim transmits their own, MEV flash bots use a tactic known as \"sandwich attacks\" to steal money from users. This is a cunning method to change the asset\u2019s base price so that the bot can take the user\u2019s money for the difference in price. Since September 2022, this has been one of the largest MEV bot attacks that they have come across.\n\n\nThe incident was first reported on Twitter by smart contract developer \"3155.eth,\" and PeckShield later found the stolen funds at three Ethereum addresses that were combined from eight other addresses. The creator of the main MEV program used on Ethereum, known as MEV-Boost, Flashbots, has reacted with a fix to stop similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\n\nThe team has added a feature that tells relayers, a reliable middleman between block creators and validators, to publish a signed block before sending its contents to a proposer, a move that was not previously present. With this action, we hope to lessen the possibility that a malicious proposer within MEV-Boost will propose a block that differs from the one they got from a relay.\n\nHistory Of Bitcoin!"
