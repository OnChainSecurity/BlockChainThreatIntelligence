The bundles, which were supposed to execute reverse swaps and take profits, were found to be broken, with the backrun transactions being reverted. This has led to questions about who is to blame for the exploit.\n\n#MEV The interesting bundles from sandwich-focused MEV bots on https://t.co/4AYDU3xkN3 seems broken.

(@peckshield) April 3, 2023\n\nAccording to an analysis, the bot-exploiting transactions replaced the victim transactions, which already included the reverse swap to take profits. This has reportedly raised concerns about the potential risks associated with using MEV bots on DEXs, and the need for more robust security measures to prevent such incidents.\n\nFurther analysis of the recent exploit has revealed that the stolen funds are primarily located in three addresses: 0x3c98\u20268eb ($20M), 0x5b04\u20265b6 ($2.3M), and 0x27bf\u2026f69 (~$3M). Interestingly, it has also been discovered that Kucoin, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, initially funded eight addresses involved in the exploit.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert The stolen funds (~25M) are mainly located in 3 addresses, 0x3c98\u20268eb (~20M), 0x5b04\u20265b6 (~2.3M) and 0x27bf\u2026f69 (~3M)0x84cB\u20268D1, 0x88Fd\u20267EE, 0x94e0\u202687C, 0x0429\u202646C, 0xEafc\u2026D1B, 0xCaCE\u2026975, 0x5b04\u20265b6 and 0x27bf\u2026f69 these 8 addresses were\u2026 https://t.co/7g60VX8ica pic.twitter.com/7oFwYSVoyn\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) April 3, 2023\n\n\n3rd party Ad.

This has allegedly raised suspicions of a rogue validator being involved, as Aztec funded the proposer of the exploit. According to him, the incident could be a significant turning point for the entire MEV ecosystem, and it appears to be a well-planned attack.\n\nFurther analysis of the exploit has revealed that the perpetrator became a validator only 18 days ago and prepared the tokens 16 days ago. As the developer suggested, many details need to be examined to determine the full extent of the incident.\n\nThe post $25M Siphoned in Ethereum MEV Exploit: PeckShieldAlert appeared first on Coin Edition.\n\nSee original on CoinEdition\n\nWhich stock should you buy in your very next trade?\nAI computing powers are changing the stock market.
