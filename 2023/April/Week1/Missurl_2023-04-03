A validator is responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain.\nThe attack has the potential to transform the MEV ecosystem because MEV extractors will be wonder \"which Ethereum validators are malicious,\" former Ethereum Foundation member Hudson Jameson said in a tweet.\nMEV flashbots use a technique called \"sandwich attacks\" to steal value from users by sending transactions just before and after a victim sends his or her own. This is a malicious way of manipulating the underlying price of the asset so that the bot can steal the price difference from the user.\n\nIn this case, OtterSec added that the validator responsible for causing the attack had funded his wallet more than two weeks ago from privacy layer Aztec Network, suggesting that it was a planned attack.\nBlockchain sleuth Peckshield revealed that the $20 million in stolen funds are spread across three wallets, with eight linked addresses being originally funded from Indian crypto exchange KuCoin.\nEdited by Sheldon Reback and Mark Nacinovich.\n\nNewsletter\nEvery Weekday\nFirstMover\nSign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.\n\nEnter your Email\nEnter your Email\n\nSign Up\nBy clicking \u2018Sign Up\u2019, you agree to receive newsletter from CoinDesk as well as other partner offers and accept our terms of services and privacy policy.\n\nDisclosure\n\nPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.\n\nCoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.
