ConsenSys Diligence\n6. Runtime Verification\n7. Quantstamp\n8. Trail of Bits\nThe bottom line-There\u2019s plenty of choices if you are looking for a blockchain audit\nSmart contracts are a great innovation that allows developers to create decentralized protocols which operate trustlessly and can\u2019t be censored by third parties. However, smart contracts also come with a unique set of risks, which make blockchain audit services invaluable. \n\nOnce a smart contract is deployed on a blockchain like Ethereum, it remains immutable. This means that any bugs or vulnerabilities in the smart contract cannot be fixed once it\u2019s deployed. Upgrading a contract requires a new version of the contract to be deployed and the previous contract\u2019s state needs to be migrated to the new contract. \n\nBlockchain transactions are irreversible, which means that if an attacker successfully exploits a smart contract and steals funds, it can be very difficult to get the stolen funds back. \n\nAnother reason why security is of the utmost importance for smart contracts is that smart contracts often manage significant amounts of value. Some decentralized finance protocols (which are essentially a collection of smart contracts) like Maker and Aave manage billions of dollars worth of tokens. Therefore, any vulnerabilities can lead to devastating losses.\n\nIn this article, we will be featuring the top 8 blockchain audit firms that help blockchain projects ensure that their smart contracts don\u2019t contain any hidden vulnerabilities and perform as expected. \n\nThe top 8 blockchain audit firms\nWith the growth of decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces and other blockchain-based applications, the demand for blockchain audits has grown tremendously.
