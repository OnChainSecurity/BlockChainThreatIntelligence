        "original_content": "Correction: The attacker repeatedly transferred\n[$CFC] tokens to the pair and then invoked\nfunction skim(), the function within the _transfer() is triggered to burn\n[$CFC] from the 'from' address, thereby\ndecreasing the quantity of [$CFC] within\nthe LP pair. This then facilitates a swap of a minimal amount of\n[$CFC] for a large amount of\n[$SAFE], leading to profit."
