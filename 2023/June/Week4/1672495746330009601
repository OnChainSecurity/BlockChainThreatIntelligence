        "original_content": "Shido on BSC was exploited, resulting in the attacker profiting 977 WBNB\n(worth approximately $242,000). The attacker swapped most of the profits for\nETH and bridged them to Ethereum via cBridge, where they laundered the funds\nusing TornadoCash. It's worth noting that the attacker also deposited 1 BNB\ninto TC on BSC, which suggests that they may continue to operate on BSC in the\nfuture.
