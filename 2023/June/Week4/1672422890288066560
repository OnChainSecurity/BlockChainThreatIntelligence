Due to the configuration error of the\nShidoLock contract (the unlock time is fixed at 14:00 on June 23, 2023,\nregardless of the collateral time), the attacker can immediately unlock and\nobtain a large number of v2 tokens. 4/ The attacker swaps v2 tokens in the\ntrading pair for 1,016 WBNB, and after repaying the flash loan, profits 976\nWBNB.[![Visit\nBscScan.com](https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/1830544233360400385/tsw7b85-?format=jpg&name=small)](https://t.co/XhxAO2oooK)\n"
