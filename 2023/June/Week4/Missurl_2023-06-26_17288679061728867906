Each has different methods and significant security implications. It\u2019s crucial to understand the differences.\n\u2014 A hot wallet is a piece of software you install on your smartphone or laptop to store private keys.\n\u2014 A cold wallet is a type of crypto wallet that never interacts with any smart contracts. Sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nHot Wallets vs Cold Wallets: What Are They?\n\n\nBoth hot and cold wallets secure your crypto private keys, but they do so in different ways. This has important implications for your security. And that\u2019s not the only critical difference between these two wallets. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\n\nWhat Is a Hot Wallet?\n\n\nA \nhot wallet\n, sometimes known as a software wallet, is a piece of software you install on your smartphone or laptop. It is normally protected by a password set by you, ensuring that nobody can physically access the wallet via your device.\n\n\nSo why exactly is a hot wallet known as \u201chot\u201d? The defining feature of this type of wallet is that it generates your seed phrase online, and subsequently stores your private keys online too.\u00a0\n\n\nSeed Phrase Generated Online\n\n\nA hot wallet generates your seed phrase in an online environment and displays it to you on the screen of your computer or phone when you first launch the wallet. The problem with this system is that, once your seed phrase (or secret recovery phrase) has been online once, you have no way of knowing who has seen or accessed it remotely. This is the problem with data generated by a hot wallet.\n\n\nPrivate Keys Live Online\n\n\nHot wallets also store your private keys digitally, within their application on your phone or computer. Since these devices are always connected to the internet, your private keys are also constantly online.\u00a0\n\n\nSo to recap \u2013 what makes a hot wallet \u201chot\u201d is the fact that both your seed phrase and your private keys are online. And once these pieces of data have been online once, you have no way of knowing they are still secret.\n\n\nWhat Is a Hot Wallet For?\n\n\nHaving your private keys online makes transacting very straightforward. It\u2019s simple \u2014 just log in and start interacting with online applications. If you\u2019re new to the crypto world, the hot wallet can be an attractive starting point. It\u2019s easy to download, gives you custody of your private key and makes it easy to interact with crypto platforms.\n\n\nBut all of these great benefits come with some significant security implications.\n\n\nThe Risks of Hot Wallets\n\n\nSecuring private keys online might be convenient for browsing Web3, but it also leaves you vulnerable to hacks deployed via your internet connection. For example, a sophisticated hacker can use your connected device as an attack vector, using it to penetrate your hot wallet and extract your private keys remotely. Securing private keys on a computer or phone means they are always exposed to this type of risk.\n\n\nThus, hot wallets are great for making quick and convenient transactions, but they aren\u2019t suitable for securing assets of high value, since private keys connected to the internet are always at risk of being hacked.\n\n\nSo, now you know all about hot wallets, let\u2019s look now at cold wallets.\n\n\nWhat Is a Cold Wallet?\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with some clarity. A \ncold wallet\n is commonly misunderstood to be simply the opposite of a hot wallet \u2013 but this is inaccurate. While a cold wallet does generate and store your private keys in an offline environment, it also has another essential trait: \nit never interacts with smart contracts\n. \n\n\nThis defining feature means a true cold wallet goes beyond simply keeping your keys offline, it also air gaps you from potentially malicious smart contracts as well.\n\n\nWhat Is a Cold Wallet For?\n\n\nThe purpose of a true cold wallet is to act as a vault for the bulk of your crypto, isolating it from all potential risks. You can think of it as a \u201csavings\u201d account, where you keep the majority of your funds but don\u2019t actively transact.\n\n\nWhy Do You Need a Cold Wallet?\n\n\nAs you know, an offline private key is the only way to secure yourself against hacks and malware. But there are some risks even offline keys cannot protect you from.\n\n\nUsing dApps and Web3 usually means interacting with smart contracts. And whenever you interact with a smart contract, you expose your crypto wallet to the conditions of that contract. If you make a mistake \u2013 i.e., if you don\u2019t read the conditions properly or sign something you don\u2019t quite understand \u2013 you\u2019re effectively opening the door to the contents of your wallet.\n\n\nMistakes happen, and since not all smart contract transactions can be displayed clearly, even an advanced crypto user can fall prey to this type of error.\n\n\nSo how can you remove the risk posed by smart contracts, while continuing to explore Web3 platforms? The answer is \u2013 you can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\nCold wallets exist simply to\n mitigate that risk\n. By having an account that doesn\u2019t encounter these sorts of dangers, you can store your most valuable digital assets with confidence.\n\n\nSo how does that work exactly?\n\n\nWell, there are several types of cold wallets, including paper wallets and sound wallets. However, typically people opt for the easiest cold storage solution; hardware wallets.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy Is a Hardware Wallet a Good Cold Crypto Storage Solution?\n\n\nWhile many people use the term \u201ccold wallet\u201d interchangeably with \u201chardware wallet\u201d, these two concepts are not the same thing. To explain, a hardware wallet is a physical device. However, it tends to be a popular option as a cold wallet due to its key features: It never connects to the internet and secures your private keys in an offline environment.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is an important detail since it ensures your keys cannot be accessed remotely. Even the most sophisticated hacker cannot penetrate your hardware device \u2013 it is simply out of reach.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother key reason hardware wallets make great cold wallets: They don\u2019t require any special technology other than the hardware device you already have and some commitment on your part.\n\n\nUsing your Ledger device, you can set up multiple accounts\u2014with each account having a specific use. That means you can set up an account on your Ledger device that you designate as a cold wallet\u2014simply for sending and receiving assets.\u00a0\n\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t connect that account to apps and services, it will stay protected from malicious smart contracts.\u00a0 Be warned though, when you\u2019re using a hardware wallet, whether your account connects to an app or not is completely down to you.\n\n\nHot Wallet vs Cold Wallet: Which is Better?\n\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself this question, you shouldn\u2019t be. There is no need to choose between a hot and cold wallet, because you can access the utility of both from the same Ledger device, while your private keys remain offline.\u00a0\n\n\nLedger devices allow you to create unlimited accounts (individual wallets with private keys) for each blockchain asset. Each of these exists independently\u2014protected from the approvals of the other. This enables you to \nsegregate your crypto assets\n into different wallets, designating one as a secure vault, and another for interacting with Web3.\n\n\nSo now you know what\u2019s possible, let\u2019s explore how it works in practice.\n\n\nHot Wallet vs Cold Wallet: How To Set Them Up\n\n\nSay you\u2019re securing 10 ETH with your \nhardware wallets\n like the \nLedger Nano S Plus\n, \nLedger Nano X\n, \nLedger Flex\n, or \nLedger Stax\n. To keep risks to your assets at an absolute minimum, you should secure the bulk of your ETH in a wallet that never interacts with smart contracts.\u00a0\n\n\nTo do this, you\u2019ll simply create two ETH accounts within your Ledger, designating one as a vault that never interacts with Web3. This is your cold wallet, and you\u2019ll name it clearly to make sure it stays that way.\n\n\nMeanwhile, you will designate the other ETH wallet as an active Web3 wallet (also clearly named), using it for smart contract transactions and exploring Web3. You will only transfer ETH into this wallet when you need it, and only the specific amount you require.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough this is not a hot wallet \u2013 because its private keys are still secured offline, inside your Ledger device \u2013 you can still use it to connect to hot wallet interfaces to interact with blockchain apps outside of the Ledger ecosystem. For example, you can \nconnect your Ledger to metamask \nto interact with countless dApps on the Ethereum network.\n\n\nLedger also supports several other third-party wallets across multiple chains, such as Electrum, MyEtherWallet, Yoroi Wallet, Phantom, Temple, and Kukai, so you\u2019re free to explore with peace of mind.\n\n\nFreedom Is Security\n\n\nSo now you know, hot and cold wallets are for completely different use cases. While software (or hot) wallets are designed primarily as a gateway to blockchain apps and services, cold wallets exist for the complete opposite reason. In short, cold wallets offer a way to store valuable assets securely.\n\n\nFreedom means not having to choose between exploring Web3 and staying secure. With a Ledger and some basic wallet organization, you can manage the risks your crypto faces, even as you embrace the growing ecosystem of dApps and services.\n\n\nStay informed and stay secure \u2013 YOU are in control of your crypto.\n\n\n\n"
