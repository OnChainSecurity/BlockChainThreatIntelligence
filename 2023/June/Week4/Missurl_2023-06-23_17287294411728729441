        "original_content": "The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s official \u2018update\u2019 email account was compromised and used to send out a phishing scam on June 23, the foundation revealed in a July 2 blog post\nThe \nEthereum\n Foundation\u2019s official \u2018update\u2019 email account was compromised and used to send out a phishing scam on June 23, the foundation \nrevealed\n in a July 2 blog post. The foundation has since regained control of the account, halting the spread of malicious emails.\nThe breach resulted in 35,794 scam emails being sent to the foundation\u2019s subscribers and other individuals using the official email address updates@blog.ethereum.org. Fortunately, the foundation\u2019s investigation concluded that no cryptocurrency was lost in the attack. However, the email addresses of 81 subscribers may have been exposed to the hacker.\nThe fraudulent emails falsely announced a partnership between the Ethereum Foundation and the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (LidoDAO), promising a 6.8% yield on staked Ether (stETH), Wrapped Ether (WETH), or Ether deposits. The email misleadingly assured recipients that their staking would be \u201cProtected and Verified by The Ethereum Foundation.\u201d\nRecipients who clicked the \u201cBegin Staking\u201d button in the email were redirected to a malicious web application, posing as a \u201cStaking Launchpad.\u201d Within this app, clicking the \u201cStake\u201d button initiated a transaction designed to drain the user\u2019s wallet if approved.\nUpon discovering the malicious emails, the foundation acted swiftly to block the attacker from sending more emails. They also secured the compromised access point to the mailing list provider, preventing further unauthorized access. Additionally, the foundation alerted various blacklists, Web3 wallet providers, and Cloudflare to warn users attempting to visit the malicious site.\nDespite the breach, no victims appear to have lost funds. The foundation analyzed on-chain transactions made to the attacker between the time the emails were sent and the malicious domain was blocked. The data suggests that no funds were lost during this phishing campaign.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).
