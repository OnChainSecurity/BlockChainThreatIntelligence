        "original_content": "Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers\nNew coin mixers aim to preserve privacy while revealing just enough data to stay on the right side of the law.When the U.S. government sanctioned coin mixer Tornado Cash, many thought it might spell the end for illicit crypto mixing services. But they\u2019re back - and with a glossy new institutional sheen and legit use cases to help traders and funds keep their market moves a \"trade\" secret.\n\nTornado Cash is what is known as a \"mixer,\" a \"coin anonymizer\" that breaks the identifying links in blockchain transactions, providing a certain degree of anonymity for users.\nThe reasons people use coin anonymizers vary from criminality to ideology. Bad actors can use Tornado Cash to hide their naughty deeds, effectively laundering the proceeds of crime and preventing stolen crypto from being traced to them on the blockchain. That\u2019s why the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the protocol last year. \nBut there are legitimate reasons for not wanting your every transaction tracked, and supporters argue that Tornado Cash provides important privacy infrastructure. But is it possible to build a privacy-preserving protocol that provides regulators with just enough information to know users are staying on the right side of the law? \nVarious developers are experimenting with redesigned mixers using ZK-proofs and believe there\u2019s a way to make it happen.\"The mathematical machinery has been around for quite a while,\" explains Matthew Niemerg, co-founder of Aleph Zero.\n\"It\u2019s more about designing a solution that balances an individual\u2019s privacy from the broader public while allowing the revealing of limited pieces of data to particular entities, such as banks or government agencies, using ZK-proofs. It takes time to design such a scheme and bring a product to market.\"\nBut the big use case for these new coin mixers won\u2019t be dodgy crypto thieves: It\u2019ll be the big institutions and hedge funds, trying to get ahead of front-running bots and to keep their business dealings secret from competitors.How does Tornado Cash work? \nTornado Cash is an important yet controversial product in the Ethereum ecosystem. The decentralized, noncustodial privacy solution accepts ETH and ERC-20 deposits to muddy transactional histories by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. Send some coins in, take some different coins out. \n\nTornado Cash\u2019s origin story is a fascinating account of true decentralization dreamers fighting the regulatory powers that be. Tornado Cash first launched in August 2019 but was initially \"experimental software\" because the original software developers retained control over user funds through a multisig wallet.In 2020, Tornado Cash\u2019s developers burned their admin keys, turning the privacy tool into permissionless code. Tornado Cash was supposedly a truly perpetual persistent script, \"completely trustless and unstoppable,\" and the developers believed they were no longer responsible for the platform as the application operated as self-executing code.\n\nBurning the admin keys had two goals. It removed the possibility of admin key \"rug pull\" risk, where a team member can steal all the funds out of the smart contract and disappear. And, in theory, the idea was that by burning their admin keys and relinquishing control to the ether, they\u2019d be able to avoid potential legal ramifications.\n\nThen they came for the Tornado Cash developers.In August 2022, Tornado Cash was the target of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which sanctioned the digital currency mixer for being a money-laundering tool. There was a lot of debate over whether it was possible to sanction a piece of code, and effectively, they went after the developers and U.S.-based users, who could qualify as a sanctioned entity. This led to accusations of clumsy law enforcement shooting the evangelicals. \n\nStopping Tornado Cash completely is beyond the Treasury\u2019s ability at present. This is because open-source software built upon the Ethereum blockchain is accessible to anyone and runs mostly autonomously. Tornado Cash\u2019s code is still accessible and can be easily copied and resurrected under different aliases and on other Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains. \n\nDevelopers have already forked Tornado Cash\u2019s code to build Privacy Pools on the Optimism blockchain. Ameen Soleimani, co-founder and CEO of SpankChain - an adult service on-chain - was a notable supporter.No one seems to have a solution for the regulators playing whack-a-mole, but many ordinary users are deterred by the idea of using sanctioned protocols or their offshoots.\n\nAlso read: Porn payments were supposed to be crypto\u2019s killer app: Why have they flopped?\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for crypto privacy that doesn\u2019t offend the powers that be?\n\nTornado Cash Mark II has already launched.\n\nWhat replaces Tornado Cash?\nThe metrics are simple: providing tech that ensures user privacy while satisfying the regulators\u2019 Know Your Customer demands (so that banks can identify their customers for regulators). Easy. \n\nThe aforementioned Privacy Pools launched its early experimental code in March 2023 and has its sights set on becoming an improved Tornado Cash, but meeting regulatory demands is a tough ask. The solution works on a technical level but regulatory enforcement is perhaps likely at some point. Founding contributor Soleimani even tweeted that would be the case eventually. He argued that Privacy Pools is a kind of an experiment with the aim of helping \"regulators understand a potentially more attractive equilibrium between privacy and regulation that we didn\u2019t even know existed a few months ago.\" He is referring to developments such as zero-knowledge proofs, a computational proof of a transaction that took place while anonymizing the terms of the transaction as used in private cryptocurrency Zcash and in a slightly different way in layer-2 protocols, such as StarkNet. But it\u2019s not clear that will be enough for regulators. \n\nSoleimani hints on Twitter the regulators will keep coming. "
