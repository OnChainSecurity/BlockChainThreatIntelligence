In order to understand the\nnuanced movements we discussed in Episode 1 & 3, we need keen insight and\npowerful tools. In this episode, we dive deep into a powerful on-chain\nanalytics tools that enable us to grasp the pulse of this landscape -\n\n[@Phalcon_xyz](/Phalcon_xyz)\n\nExplorer powered by\n\n[@BlockSecTeam](/BlockSecTeam)\n\n! Phalcon Explorer: Phalcon Explorer stands as one of the most sophisticated\nblock explorers in existence supporting multipe blockchains. This isn't your\nordinary etherscan \u2013 Phalcon Explorer provides you with a streamlined, real-\ntime understanding of transaction data that would be otherwise obscured in raw\nformat Why do i use it? Advanced Visualization [FUND FLOW]: halcon Explorer\ndelivers an intuitive understanding of the blockchain through advanced\nvisualization tools. Patterns become strikingly evident and trends emerge from\nthe chaos. Debug Mode: Once you're in debug mode, you'll see five panels: 1\\.\nCall Trace Panel: This shows you the path of external calls and events. 2\\.\nSource Code Panel: Here, you can see the contract's source code. It highlights\nthe exact line where a function call happens 3\\. Debug Console: This is a\nstep-by-step debug tool that lets you examine each call 4\\. Debug Trace Panel:\nThis panel displays the call stack of the current contract, including both\ninternal and external calls 5\\. Parameters & Return Values Panel: This\ndisplays the parameters of the calls and what they return. Debug Mode is\nlovely, It makes understanding complex interactions so much easier!\n\n[@Phalcon_xyz](/Phalcon_xyz)\n\n: [https://explorer.phalcon.xyz](https://t.co/Ukw2QzU2z7)\n[https://x.com/phalcon_xyz/st/Phalcon_xyz/status/1663185322581299201?s=20\u2026](/Phalcon_xyz/status/1663185322581299201?s=20)\n[https://x.com/phalcon_xyz/st/Phalcon_xyz/status/1662832044215537665?s=20\u2026](/Phalcon_xyz/status/1662832044215537665?s=20)\nWe all know that knowledge is power, and in the world of DeFi, the power lies\nin understanding the nuances of the blockchain These tools are very valuable.\nFor me it brings clarity to complex interactions, which otherwise wouldn't\nhave been clear to me. Stay tuned for more insights in the upcoming episodes.\nDo not forget to share and like this for the algorithm!"
