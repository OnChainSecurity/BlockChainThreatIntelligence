Except the difference here is it\u2019s not that funny when your hard-earned money is swept. Especially when you willingly gave it away to the person scamming you. Sadly, that\u2019s the comedic effect of a rugpull. You literally can\u2019t do anything about it. Rugpulls are malicious scams that leave you second-guessing the reflection in your mirror. But don\u2019t you worry, everyone falls victim as it\u2019s the second most common type of security issue in web3.\nIn this guide you\u2019ll know every important thing there is about rugpulls in crypto and NFTs. You\u2019ll understand why it happens and whether there is any legal action against it. In the end you\u2019ll learn how to protect yourself from this mischievous scam.\nWhat Is A Rugpull?\nThe name of this scam comes from the idiom \"to pull the rug out\" from under someone. Imagine it like someone setting up a beautiful rug with a table on it. Preparing lovely meals for you every day. Sweet-talking you into giving out money for a business idea. Everyday you chat and eat and invest your money. You\u2019re having fun and feeling like generational wealth is on the way. Until one day, the scammer pulls the rug right from under you and the whole set up collapses in your face. You\u2019re left with ruins,empty hopes, and a drained pocket. That\u2019s what a rugpull feels like. Technically speaking, it\u2019s a type of scam in the DeFi and NFT industry. It\u2019s a malicious maneuver that goes like:\nScammer hypes a new token\n\u2192 attracts investor money\n\u2192 runs away after collecting the money\n\u2192 Leaves investors in shambles. \nWhat is an NFT Rugpull?\nIt\u2019s the same concept that goes on in the De-Fi sector. Instead of hyping a certain new token - or alt coin- with promises of great gains, scammers use NFT projects. Therefore, NFT rugpulls are extremely common. Usually it starts during the pre-launch phase of an NFT project like this:\nCreators of the NFT collection attract early \"minters\" for whitelists \nThey excessively promote and hype it on social media through crypto influencers \nMany degens rush to mint the collection, and after the collection mints out:\nScammers transfer the funds out of the ecosystem and vanish \nOR wait for the floor price to a certain level THEN siphon the funds and vanish\nThis means that an NFT rugpull may take years to fully happen. That\u2019s the tricky part, as you may never realize it. A Kid Called Beast was suspected of rugpulling upon mint, and some still believe in that controversy. Check out the story here.\nType of Rug Pulls \nDumping, liquidity stealing, and limiting sell orders are the three most common types of a rugpull. They fall into two categories:\nHard rugpull: It\u2019s when a developer has no intention of ever completing a project and intends to scam investors from the start. They hardwire a project\u2019s smart contract code to leave an avenue open for theft. \nSoft rugpull: It doesn\u2019t have code-level fraud. Instead, soft pulls tend to rely on marketing hype to falsely inflate a project\u2019s value. Then the project\u2019s founders shut it down. Either slowly over years or instantly run away with the money.\n1- Dumping (Pump and Dump)\npump and dump\n\nThis type of soft rug pull is similar to penny stock pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nThe developers of a project hype it up to draw investors. Then, they encourage trading activity using marketing tools - mainly social media and influencers. \nAfter inflating a coin or NFT\u2019s value\n\u2192 the developers rapidly sell off their own supply\n\u2192 the token\u2019s value flops\n\u2192 investors get stuck with mostly worthless assets.\nDumping schemes are soft rugpulls that can span hours or years - depending on the developers. Hence, it can sometimes look like normal market volatility rather than a deliberate scam.\n2- Liquidity Stealing\nliquidity stealing\nLiquidity signifies how easily you can convert an asset (NFT or Cryptocurrency) to another asset (USD) without affecting its market price.\n\nA liquidity pool is a collection of locked funds in a smart contract. so, people interested in the project or currency will stake the token in its smart contract to provide liquidity.\n\nThe more assets in a pool\n\u2192  the more liquidity the pool has\n\u2192 the easier it is to trade and convert the currency.\n\nLiquidity stealing is a hard rugpull since developers intentionally build loopholes in the smart contract\u2019s code:\n\nThey steal the pool of tokens from their investors\n\u2192 this removes all the value injected into the currency or NFT\n\u2192 drives its price down to zero\n\u2192 investors left with nothing.\n\n3- Limiting Sell Orders\nlimiting sell orders\nThis is another kind of malicious hard rug pull. This scheme goes like:\n\nThe project\u2019s developer includes restrictions on selling in the tokens\u2019 code \u2192 Investors can keep buying BUT they can\u2019t sell unless a developer allows it \u2192 Scammers can dump their tokens whenever they want \u2192 this leaves investors stuck with worthless assets.\n\nWhy Do Rugpulls Happen?\nLong story short, the DeFi and NFT spaces are prone to rugpull scams because:\n\nIt\u2019s cheap and easy to create new tokens on any blockchain. Also, to get them listed on decentralized exchanges (DEX) without a code audit.\nIt makes the scammers a shit ton of money with minimal effort. All they have to do is sell their ethics to the devil.\nActually the main reason it\u2019s easy : FOMO and seeking generational wealth.\n\nThis is rooted in Bitcoin\u2019s history and Cryptopunks NFTs in how they made people billionaires with time. Everyone is still looking out for the next Bitcoin-like or Cryptopunk success stories. But that\u2019s not gonna happen. Bitcoin and Cryptopunks made people tons of money because THEY WERE THE FIRST CRYPTOCURRENCY AND NFT TO EVER EXIST. So, sorry to burst your bubble, but get over finding the new multi-million money-making hype. \n\nAre Rugpulls Illegal?\nRed Flags\n\nLet\u2019s make it clear that rugpulls are always unethical but unfortunately not always illegal. \n\nHard rugpulls are illegal because there is software proof in the smart contract that the developer had the intention of stealing investor\u2019s funds. \nHowever, there is no legal law against soft rugpulls, because the smart contract is clean. Since it may take years to finally occur, it seems as if the developers are still actively working on the project, and they may be. It may also look like the project tanked because of market fluctuations. Sorry.\nEither way, like most fraudulent activities in the crypto industry, both types can be challenging to track and prosecute. Tracking illegal activities in crypto and NFTs is still very novel. Figuring out what counts as an investment contract (a security) or not is tricky. If you\u2019re curious about the legal issues in web3, this guide is for you!\n\nExamples: Incidents in Web3 \nAccording to findings of Comparitech, $26 billion has been lost to cryptocurrency and NFT rugpulls and scams to date! We can notice from the chart below how rugpulling scams have been insanely increasing at the beginning of 2022. Obviously, it\u2019s a lucrative business.\n\nrugpull statistics\n\nTherefore, to give you more of an idea as to how much money such scammers make, here\u2019s a swift list of the most common rugpulls to date:\n\n2014\n\u2192 OneCoin: $4 billion\n\n2021\n\u2192 StableMagnet, $27M drained\n\u2192 AnubisDAO $60 million\n\u2192 Frosties $1.1 million\n\u2192 Thodex, $2 B drained \n\n2022\n\u2192 AniMoon NFT, $6.3M drained\n\u2192 Teddy Doge, $4.5M drained \n\n2023\n\u2192 Franklinisbored 2000 ETH one-of-a-kind rugpull \n\n\u2192 According to Coindesk, a wave of scams and hacking incidents resulted in cumulative losses of $155.5 in the months of April and May. Which explains why the chart above is spiking with scams in 2023.\n\nHow To Protect Yourself From A Rugpull?\nhow to protect yourself from rugpull\n\nPeople fall victim to rugpulls due to insufficient awareness about cybersecurity. Here are 5 clear signs that scream \"You\u2019re being rugged!\" \n\n1- Undoxxed Developers\nThis should be obvious by now. Our mothers taught us at a young age not to take anything from strangers. So why the hell would anyone give away money to anonymous people online? Always double check who you are dealing with. Go all FBI on their backgrounds. This is the normal thing to do. I know it\u2019s kind of ironic to say, since the founder of Bitcoin is anonymous to this day, but Bitcoin is the dominant coin we trust with a heartbeat. It\u2019s not the same with new projects or coins, it\u2019s a whole different case story.\n\n2- No Liquidity Locked\nRemember the explanation about liquidity stealing? To prevent falling victim to that:\n\nCHECK IF THE CURENCY OR NFT IS LIQUIDITY LOCKED. With no liquidity lock on the token supply in place, nothing stops the project creators from running off with the entirety of the liquidity.\n\nAlso, check the percentage of the locked liquidity pool:\n\nA lock is only helpful in proportion to the amount of the liquidity pool it secures\n\u2192 It\u2019s known as total value locked (TVL)\n\u2192 should be between 80% and 100%. \n\n3- Limits On Sell Orders\nGood news is you can also protect yourself against limit-on-sell-order rugpulls. Since selling restrictions are buried in code, it can be difficult to identify whether there is malicious activity. The best way is to test it out yourself :\n\nPurchase a tiny amount of the new coin or NFT\nImmediately attempt to sell it\nIf there are problems selling what was just purchased\n\u2192 the project is likely a hard rugpull. \n4- Suspiciously High Yields\nWhen tokens offer insanely high an annual percentage yield (APY), it usually means equally high risks. Not necessarily indicative of a scam, but seriously, if something sounds too good to be true\u2026 most of the time it is! WHY RISK IT?\n\nAlso, if the yields for a new coin seem suspiciously high YET it doesn\u2019t turn out to be a rug pull \u2192  it\u2019s likely a Ponzi scheme.\n\nRings any bells? Ah yes, SBF and his FTX ponzi scheme that crashed the market like a wrecking ball.\n\n5- No External Audit\nSince not all of us can understand smart contract code, there are third-party auditors who can do it. Also, NFT project or cryptocurrency audits are now standard practice. It makes a whole lot of sense. Because, if an asset\u2019s smart contract can\u2019t pass a basic audit, why the hell risk investing in it? \n\nSo point is, don\u2019t just take a development team\u2019s word that an audit has taken place. Do it yourself and use reputable third-party tools. They show you that there\u2019s nothing malicious  in the code and give you peace of mind. Here\u2019s a couple handy trust-worthy audit tools:\n\nCertiK\nHacken\nCertora\nClosing Thoughts: BE SKEPTIC\nA healthy dose of FUD and skepticism is useful when sorting through crypto hype. Especially when it comes to rugpull plots. Therefore, as a rule of thumb , don\u2019t invest money you can\u2019t afford to lose. Always question the risks of web3 and whether anything makes sense to you.\n\nActually, you should always take care of your mental state. As the crypto space can become very toxic very easily. So, make sure you\u2019re not easily intimidated into things.\n\nDon\u2019t stop researching and don\u2019t stop reading! Carry on to the ultimate guide on NFT scams and stop losing your money.\n\n\n"
