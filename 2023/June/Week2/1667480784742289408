In addition to the\n[$ATL] tokens siphoned from the Atlantis\ncontracts by 0xeade07, a total of nearly $1 million in assets have flowed into\n0xeade07 (some of which have already been transferred to address 0xd8e918).\nCheck the details:\n[https://metasleuth.io/result/bsc/0xEADe071FF23bceF312deC938eCE29f7da62CF45b?source=0cf38380-e10c-4d06-8066-00611b9cafab\u2026](https://t.co/F4z0M6ceJk)"
