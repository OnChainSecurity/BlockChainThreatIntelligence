        "original_content": "What is a Rug Pull Scam?\nA \u2018Rug Pull\u2019 scam is a type of exit scam in the cryptocurrency space. While the specifics differ from case to case, it can be explained broadly as a scam which leaves investors or token holders suddenly illiquid with worthless holdings.\nA common example of a rug pull scam is a project whose founders have stopped development on the project and have sold or removed all liquidity making the tokens essentially worthless.\nProjects that rug pull are typically new projects trading primarily on DEXs. This is because it\u2019s easier for new projects to source liquidity and commence trading on DEXs as they are mostly permissionless and do not require any KYC or AML documentation.The \u2018Rug Pull\u2019 scam seems to have picked up steam last year, a report by Chainalysis found that nearly 37% of all cryptocurrency scam revenue in 2021 was from Rug Pulls. This is quite a leap in comparison to the 1% in scam revenue contribution that rug pulls had in 2020. I suspect this is likely due to the increased inflow of retail investors and projects entering the market due to the 2021 bull run.\nThree Major Rug Pull Scams\nThere are three major types of scams that fall under the definition of a Rug Pull scam. The difference between each lies in the method used to execute the scam. As such the three main methods are,Liquidity stealing\nWhen new tokens launch, the development team usually sources liquidity for the token by creating a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (DEX). If you\u2019re not sure what a \u2018liquidity pool\u2019 is, here\u2019s a simple explanation- a liquidity pool is a combined pot of two assets that traders can trade from by depositing one of the two tokens in the pair and withdrawing an equal weight of the other.\n\nThe developers of a project are typically the biggest contributors to a liquidity pool, this means that a large portion of the assets in the pool can be withdrawn by them. Keep in mind that when developers launch liquidity pools, one of the two tokens in the liquidity pool is created by them, meaning it\u2019s zero cost to fund that side of the pool. The other token, typically ETH or BNB depending on the chain is the only real cost acquired by the team when launching the liquidity pool.However, as the project picks up attention and investors start purchasing the token, the side of the pool funded with ETH or BNB starts growing larger in size while the number of project tokens reduces in size. This means that the liquidity provider\u2019s ETH or BNB stack is relatively higher now that when they created or joined the pool.\n\nThis is where the first method of rug pulling called \u2018liquidity stealing\u2019 comes in. Once the token has achieved a high enough price, the malicious project developer can exit the scam by pulling their share of the liquidity pool. Since most development teams are the biggest or only liquidity provider in a pool, this means that once they withdraw the liquidity, token holders will be unable to exit their position as there is no liquidity to trade with. This leaves investors with worthless tokens in their wallets. This method of rug pulling is usually classified as a \u2018hard pull\u2019, which means that the intention to rug the project was clear from inception.\n\nLimiting sell orders\nThe second commonly used method in Rug Pulls is \u2018limiting sell order\u2019. This means that a malicious team behind a project will design the smart contract of the token to only allow certain wallet addresses to execute sell orders on the token. This is also commonly called a \u2018honey pot\u2019 scam.\n\nThis method allows the token price to keep pumping upwards at a rapid pace as only buy orders flood in. Retail investors are often enticed by the green-only chart and start buying the token hoping for a quick profit without doing any diligence on the project. Once the news of the investors being unable to sell the token begins gaining traction, the founders have usually exited the project and dumped the remaining project tokens to drain the liquidity of the pool.One of the popular examples of this type of rug pull is the \u2018Squid Game\u2019 token rug pull (which we\u2019ll read more on later). The Squid Game token rug pull is also iconic due to the fact that the rug pull was caught live on a Twitch live stream. Limiting sell orders is also another method that comes under \u2018hard pull\u2019.\n\nDumping\nThis is the third and most commonly used method in a rug pull. It is a pretty straightforward method of rug pulling. In the \u2018dumping\u2019 method, the team usually just sells off a massive chunk of the project tokens on the open market which dumps the price all the way down.\n\nThe method is typically used by projects that run massive social media campaigns to induce hype and buying pressure on the token. Once the token reaches a high enough price, the team dumps their tokens on the market to pocket the profits.This method is also used by projects that start out with good intentions and then turn tail when the future seems bleak. Once some teams realize the project has no future, they either sell off their share of the tokens slowly under the guise of \u2018development costs\u2019 or they sell it off in one go.\n\nDepending on whether the token was dumped at one go or slowly over time, this method of rug pulling can be classified as a \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 rug pull respectively. A \u2018soft pull\u2019 is one whose intentions to rug aren\u2019t as clear, it could be interpreted as either a mismanaged project or a scam that was slowly executed over time.\n\nHow to avoid a Rug Pull\nNow that we\u2019ve learnt the different methods of rug pulling, let\u2019s discuss how you can protect yourself from falling for them.Locked Liquidity Positions in a Pool\nAlways make sure the liquidity provided by the developer in a liquidity pool is locked. You can easily find this information by entering the contract address of the token on websites like Token Sniffer or Crypto Watchtower. If the liquidity position is not locked, it means that the funds are susceptible to being withdrawn at any time, resulting in a rug pull through the \u2018liquidity stealing\u2019 method.\n\nDon\u2019t Fall for the Hype or Price Action\nAlways do the required due diligence before investing in a token. Do not implicitly believe in the legitimacy of a project just because you\u2019ve seen them being featured everywhere on social media. The same goes for positive price action on a token, remember what we discussed regarding Honey Pots or limiting sell order rug pulls?\n\nStay Away from Projects with Anonymous Developers\nIt\u2019s better to err on the side of caution when it comes to projects with anonymous developers. While there certainly are many well-known projects with anonymous developers, the risk of a project with anonymous developers rug pulling is certainly higher due to the decreased risk of reputational damage.\n\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\nThat\u2019s right. If you ever come across a project with an absurdly high yield rate, it\u2019s more likely that it\u2019s a scam designed to pool in money before rug pulling. This also applies to whitepapers and projects with grand roadmaps that do not outline exactly how they are going to achieve their goals. While ambitious roadmaps are commendable, there needs to be a fair outline of the steps needed to accomplish them instead of vague promises.\n\nAudits\nMake sure the project you\u2019re planning to invest in has undergone an external audit from a reputable company. This will help uncover any vulnerabilities in the smart contract of the token.\n\nBe mindful of gradually declining developments on a project\nIf you don\u2019t want to find yourself at the short end of the stick after sticking with an investment for years, make sure that you regularly check up on the project\u2019s developmental milestones. If you spot a decline in the activity of a particular project or if the founders seem to be getting more distant, it\u2019s probably time that you reconsidered your investment position as this could be signs of waning interest and a potential soft rug pull.\n\nCase Studies: Some of the Biggest Rug Pulls\nThodex\nThodex, a Turkish crypto exchange, was one of the biggest rug pull of 2021. Contrary to the usual profile of rug-pulling projects, Thodex was a centralized crypto exchange with over $2.6 billion worth of user deposits.\n\nThe platform initiated the rug pull by \u2018temporarily\u2019 closing the platform to address an \"abnormal fluctuation in the company accounts.\" This froze users\u2019 access to their funds on the platform. In the meantime, its founder and CEO Faruk Fatih Ozer absconded to Albania with over $2 billion of user deposits with him. He still remains at large and has an active international warrant seeking his arrest.\n\nFrosties\nFrosties was an 8888 NFT project that launched in early 2022. It made a total of $1.3 million in primary sales. However, the team behind Frosties rug pulled the project just hours after the primary sales by deleting all their social channels and transferring the funds to various other wallets. It tweeted a message stating \"I\u2019m sorry.\"\n\nHowever, what\u2019s really intriguing about this rug pull is that the Department of Justice managed to track down the founders Ethan Nguyen and Andre Llacuna and charged them with money laundering and fraud charges relating to the rug pull. It's one of the first times someone has been charged for an NFT rug pull and if convicted, the creators face up to 20 years in prison.To track the founders, the investigation team issued subpoenas to Discord, the platform on which the project was quite active. Discord then disclosed the IP address on which the founders\u2019 usernames were active on. The team then found a Coinbase transaction that happened on the same IP address. Another subpoena later disclosed the identity of discord user \u2018Frostie\u2019 to be Ethan Nguyen.\n\nInterestingly, at the time the authorities charged them, both Ethan and Andre were already making a move for the next NFT project called \u2018Embers\u2019. If they weren\u2019t charged, this project would have also most likely ended up as a rug pull.\n\nSquid Game\nThe Squid Game token was one of those projects that rode the hype train on the back of the incredibly successful hit Korean TV show of the same name. The plot of the show featured a game show in which participants competed for a massive prize pot by taking part in \u2018death games\u2019 to be the last man standing.\n\nThe Squid Game token also issued a whitepaper that promised to deliver a play-to-earn modelled after the concept of the show. It detailed a token economy involving another \u2018Marble\u2019 token. Investors began rushing towards pouring money into the token, hoping to catch some of the price action on the back of the hype.Unfortunately, the project was a honeypot that limited the sell orders to only specific wallets owned by the team. This meant that while investors could buy the tokens, they were unable to sell them back on the market. \n\nThis caused an upward spiraling price movement that caught headlines all over the world. The token went from $0.01 at launch to almost $3000 in a week. As the token hit $2861, the team started dumping their tokens and draining the liquidity from the liquidity pool. As mentioned earlier, the exact moment was caught on live stream by a Twitch content creator.\n\nIn hindsight, investors realized that there were several red flags in the project. The whitepaper of the project had poor grammar, several spelling errors, a lack of detail on the game economy etc. (not to mention the ridiculous market cap)\n\nConclusion\nNow that you have a good idea of how rug pulls work, make sure you spot those red flags the next time you think about investing in a project. Scams will always be rampant in the crypto space, but as long we keep diligent, we can reduce the risk of exposure to such projects.\n\nIf you still have a bunch of questions you\u2019d like to get addressed, check out the FAQ section we\u2019ve listed below.asdfghjkl;'\n"
