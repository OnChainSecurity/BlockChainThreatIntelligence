A staggering ~23.8K ETH (Ethereum) and a hefty 935.3K USDC (USD Coin) have been identified among its holdings. The situation raises eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community, as such a substantial wealth remains frustratingly out of reach.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert Arkham has detected that the #PrimeTrust multisig wallet 0xf4E1\u202698f, i.e. \"the 98f Wallet,\" was the wallet mentioned in the court filing where they could not access the cryptos stored within.\n\nThe 98f Wallet currently holds ~$40M worth of cryptos, including\u2026 pic.twitter.com/R2llWAYntC\n\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 28, 2023\nIn a series of perplexing developments, PeckShield\u2019s Arkham detected an influx of around ~12K ETH into the same 98f Wallet that had been rendered inaccessible. This move adds another layer of complexity to the already confounding situation, leading to many questions surrounding the motives and individuals behind the transfers.\n\nAttacks on the rise\nRecently, PeckShield\u2019s community contributor exposed another breach on Magnate Finance.

This maneuver highlights the scammer\u2019s audacity and adaptability as they seek to exploit alternative avenues for their fraudulent proceeds.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert Our community contributor has detected that the Magnate Finance scammer has bridged ~$1M of the stolen funds to the #BNBChain pic.twitter.com/oO0yGHY82K\n\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 25, 2023\nThe cryptocurrency community remains on high alert as illicit activities within the digital finance realm persist.
