        "original_content": "The U.S. government said it believes North Korean hackers are preparing to cash out millions of dollars stolen during a spate of high-profile crypto hacks.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the FBI warned cryptocurrency companies about recent blockchain activity connected to the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency by malicious actors affiliated with the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group, also known as APT38 and \u201c\nTraderTraitor\n.\u201d\n\n\nThe FBI said that over the past 24 hours, it had tracked approximately 1,580 bitcoin \u2014 worth more than $40 million \u2014 that the North Korean hackers are currently holding in six separate crypto wallets. The FBI said these funds were stolen during \u201cseveral\u201d cryptocurrency heists.\n\n\nThis includes the theft of virtual currency from Atomic Wallet in June, which saw the hackers compromise an estimated 5,500 customer wallets to steal funds worth more than $100 million. Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic previously said it \nassessed\n with a \u201chigh level of confidence\u201d that the Lazarus Group was behind the attack, and noted that the laundering of the stolen crypto assets followed \u201ca series of steps that exactly match those employed to launder the proceeds of past hacks perpetrated by Lazarus Group.\u201d\n\n\nThe FBI also linked Lazarus Group hackers to the theft of $60 million in virtual currency from centralized crypto payment provider AlphaPo and $37 million from cryptocurrency wallet provider CoinsPaid.\n\n\nCoinsPaid, which was forced to halt operations for four days due to the incident, \nsaid\n in a July post-mortem of the attack that it suspected that Lazarus Group was responsible.\n\n\nThe wallet provider also confirmed that it was compromised after hackers contacted CoinsPaid employees via LinkedIn with high-paying job offers \u2014 \na popular tactic employed by North Korea\n\u00a0\u2014 to entice them into downloading malware-laced JumpCloud software. \nJumpCloud was recently breached by North Korean hackers\n as part of efforts to target cryptocurrency customers, which multiple cybersecurity firms linked to Lazarus Group.\n\n\nIn \nits advisory\n, the FBI warned that the North Korean hackers are preparing to cash out the $40 million in stolen funds in the coming days. Crypto organizations are urged to examine recent blockchain data linked to six Bitcoin addresses shared by the FBI and \u201cbe vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from the addresses.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe FBI will continue to expose and combat the DPRK\u2019s use of illicit activities \u2014 including cybercrime and virtual currency theft \u2014 to generate revenue for the regime,\u201d the FBI added. North Korea is known for using crypto thefts to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.\n\n\nLazarus Group has been tied to several other crypto exchange hacks, including the theft of $100 million in crypto assets from \nHarmony\u2019s Horizon Bridge\n and \nthe theft of $625 million in cryptocurrency\n from the Ronin Network, an Ethereum-based sidechain made for the popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity.\n\n\nAccording to a recent report from blockchain intelligence company \nTRM Labs\n, North Korean hackers have stolen almost $2 billion in cryptocurrency since 2018 over more than 30 attacks \u2014 including almost $1 billion in 2022 alone. Lazarus Group has stolen approximately $200 million in 2023 so far, according to the report, accounting for over 20% of all stolen crypto this year.\n\n\nThe U.S. government has announced a $10 million reward for information on members of state-sponsored North Korean threat groups, including the notorious Lazarus Group.\n\n\nNorth Korean hackers are targeting blockchain companies with malicious crypto-stealing apps\n\n\n\n"
