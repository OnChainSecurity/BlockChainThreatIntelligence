Scammers want you to pay them in ways that are hard to trace and hard to get your money back: like through a \ngift card\n, \nwire transfer\n, \npayment app\n, or \ncryptocurrency\n. Here, we\u2019ll focus on that last one \u2014 cryptocurrency \u2014 and how to avoid cryptocurrency-related scams. \n\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning: cryptocurrency is digital currency you get through an app on your phone, a website, or at a cryptocurrency ATM. Bitcoin and Ether are some of the most well-known, but there are lots of others. Scammers like to use cryptocurrencies because they don\u2019t have the same legal protections as credit or debit cards, and payments usually can\u2019t be reversed. \n\n\nSo, what do scams that involve cryptocurrency typically look like? Scammers may call, pretend to be from a \ngovernment agency\n and say you need to pay a fine \u2014 using cryptocurrency. Or they may pose as an online \nlove interest\n\u00a0who needs you to send money for an expensive medical procedure \u2014 using cryptocurrency. Or the scammer may \noffer you a job\n, but say you need to pay a fee before you get hired \u2014 using, you guessed it, cryptocurrency. \n\n\nTo avoid these and other scams, know that: \n\n\n\n\nOnly scammers demand payment in cryptocurrency.\n\u00a0No legitimate business\u00a0 or government agency is going to demand you pay with cryptocurrency \u2014 not to buy something, pay taxes or fines, and not to \u201cprotect\u201d your money. That\u2019s always a scam.\n\n\nNever pay a fee to get a job\n. If someone asks you to pay upfront for a job \u2014 with cryptocurrency or any other type of payment \u2014 or says to buy cryptocurrency to get a job, it\u2019s a scam.\n\n\nNever mix cryptocurrency and online dating\n. If you meet someone through online dating who asks you to send them cryptocurrency or wants to \u201chelp\u201d you invest in crypto, that\u2019s a scam.\n\n\n\n\nSpot a cryptocurrency scam? Report it to the FTC: \nReportFraud.ftc.gov\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
