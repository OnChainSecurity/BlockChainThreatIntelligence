But it means forfeiting custody of your crypto to a centralized custodian.\n\n\nBut \ntoken swaps\n via a decentralized protocol face their own limitations.\n\n\nDecentralized crypto exchanges\n (DEXs) are protocols designed to communicate with just one underlying blockchain. For example, Uniswap is built to handle trades of many different tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. But isn\u2019t capable of managing trades with Bitcoin or Binance SmartChain-based BNB. They simply speak a different language. To date, the most common way around this problem has been using wrapped assets. But using synthetic crypto tokens comes with its own set of security risks.\n\n\nSo \ncross-chain\n crypto traders face a conundrum: users must choose between forfeiting custody of their crypto, or accepting the security risks of using bridges and synthetic assets to trade between chains.\n\n\nTHORChain is a protocol that aims to offer a solution to this problem. Let\u2019s dive into what is THORChain, how it works, and how to use THORChain with your \nLedger hardware wallets\n such as the \nLedger Nano S Plus\n, \nLedger Nano X\n, \nLedger Flex\n, or \nLedger Stax\n.\n\n\nWhat Is THORChain?\n\n\nTHORChain is a cross-chain, decentralized liquidity protocol. It enables direct swaps between different layer-1 tokens.\n\n\nBuilt on the state-of-the-art \nCosmos\n SDK (software development kit) as part of Cosmos\u2019 \ninternet of blockchain \necosystem, THORChain currently supports 9 different layer-1 blockchains. In theory, it will also support many more in future.\n\n\nTHORChain enables users to swap native assets based on different chains. For example, you could use THORChain to swap your \nETH\n on \nEthereum\n to get \nBTC\n on the Bitcoin network. Similarly, you can exchange \nAVAX\n on Avalanche to receive \nLTC\n on Litecoin. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nHow Does THORChain Work?\n\n\nTHORChain is capable of making direct swaps between different layer-1 blockchains. This is because each of its validators runs a \nfull node\n for every network. For example, all THORnodes will run clients on Bitcoin, Binance SmartChain, Avalanche, Ethereum, Litecoin etc. On each of these networks, the THORChain vault contains pools of both the network\u2019s native currency (ie ETH, BTC, LTC), and RUNE, THORChain\u2019s own token.\n\n\nTHORnodes monitor for transactions coming into the THORChain vaults on each respective blockchain network, and confirm the incoming transaction via consensus. They then arrange for the corresponding outgoing transaction to initiate on the other blockchain of the swap, thus enabling users to \u201cinsert\u201d a given token on one chain into the THORChain protocol, and receive tokens from a completely different blockchain in return \u2013 without any central custodian.\n\n\nWhen a user wants to convert ETH to BTC using THORChain, here\u2019s what happens:\n\n\n\u2013 User\u2019s ETH is sent to ETH/RUNE pool\n\n\n\u2013 RUNE worth the value of the user\u2019s ETH is sent from ETH/RUNE to the BTC/RUNE pool\n\n\n\u2013 User gets BTC worth the RUNE sent to BTC/RUNE pool.\n\n\nTHORChain relies on several technical cornerstones, as well as its native coin \nRUNE\n, to achieve this. Let\u2019s start by looking at each of those in turn.\n\n\nTHORChain Key Technology\n\n\nCosmos SDK\n\n\nTHORChain is built on Cosmos SDK (software development kit), as part of the \nCosmos\n \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d SDK is a set of open-source tools that enable developers to build bespoke blockchains that can interoperate with each other. \n2. Bifrost\n\n\nFor this system to be effective, THORChain nodes have some specific communication requirements. Every node in the THORChain system is running a client on all of its integrated blockchains, while also communicating with one another via THORChain\u2019s central network. This is made possible by the Bifrost protocol, which is a connective node between the THORChain network, and other blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n\nBy enabling every node to monitor incoming transactions on THORChain\u2019s vaults on all blockchains, and also communicate with each other, THORChain can keep track of transactions across chains.\n\n\nTendermint consensus\n\n\nTHORChain itself is a \nProof-of-Stake (PoS)\n network. It leverages the Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) engine \u2014 a part of Cosmos \u2014 to secure the network from node failures or malicious behavior.\u00a0\n\n\nEach of the nodes is disincentivized from acting maliciously. It has staked much more than it stands to gain by duping the network. Meanwhile, the nodes themselves are completely anonymous, meaning they cannot work together to collectively subvert the network. New nodes enter and exit the active validator set every 3 days, moving all assets to new vaults with new signers.\n\n\nAutomated market maker\n\n\nThe engine controlling trades on THORChain is an \nAutomated Market Maker \n\u2013 a decentralized protocol that \u201ckeeps track of\u201d trades across all its different blockchains without a central custodian.\n\n\nSynthetic assets\n\n\nTHORChain does not wrap assets, but instead synthesizes assets from liquidity. \nSynthetic assets \nmake trading and arbitrage faster, without the need to deal with layer-1 block times or confirmations. Instead, synths settle at the speed of THORChain blocks, around 6 seconds.\n\n\nStreaming swaps\n\n\nTHORChain, with \nstreaming swaps\n,\u00a0 has the ability to break up large swaps into multiple sub-swaps executed over a period of time. In the \nslip-based fee model\n, larger swaps pay more in fees. By splitting up a trade, swappers can pay significantly less in liquidity fees, leading to significantly better price execution.\u00a0\n\n\nTHORChain Participants\n\n\nWith no central entity responsible for maintaining liquidity, updated prices, and security of the network, THORChain relies on its community to do the honors.\n\n\nWe can broadly classify every participant of THORChain under one or more of five roles: liquidity providers, node operators, traders, savers, and borrowers.\n\n\nLiquidity Providers\n\n\nLiquidity providers (LPs) are responsible for maintaining asset liquidity across liquidity pools. They commit assets from across chains paired with an equal worth of RUNE (more on this later) to respective liquidity pools.\u00a0\n\n\nAs an incentive for their contribution, the network rewards LPs with a portion of the swapping fees paid by users in the form of THORChain\u2019s native coin RUNE. The more liquidity committed, the greater the reward.\n\n\nTraders\n\n\nThe internal price of RUNE is guided by the supply of the token left within the Thorchain protocol. Traders are participants that look for \ncrypto arbitrage\n opportunities, i.e. price differences of assets within THORChain\u2019s liquidity pools and outside markets. This incentivizes them to execute high-frequency trades for profit.\n\n\nThese trades execute until the price of an asset within THORChain\u2019s pools is equal to the price across external markets. This is what keeps the value of assets in THORChain\u2019s vaults consistent with the wider market.\n\n\nNode Operators\n\n\nNode\n operators are responsible for securing the native asset vaults and adding new blocks of transactions to the chain. They listen for incoming swaps, execute the across chains, and collectively sign outbound layer-1 asset transactions.\n\n\nThe prerequisite of becoming a THORNode is to commit a bond with a \nminimum of 300,000 RUNE\n. The network uses this monetary \nstake\n as leverage over every node. Thus disincentivizing them from acting against the network or stealing funds from it.\u00a0\n\n\nIf a node still carries out any unauthorized activity, the network \nslashes\n the node\u2019s RUNE by a certain percentage.\n\n\nSavers\n\n\nTHORChain has a second type of liquidity provider \u2013 \nSavers\n. Savers deposit native assets (like BTC or ETH) into THORChain, to earn single-sided yield. To accomplish this, native assets are swapped for synthetic assets which are backed by THORChain liquidity. Savers are single-asset only and don\u2019t experience \nImpermanent Loss\n. Rewards savers receive is dynamic, based on the ratio of savers to dual liquidity.\n\n\nBorrowers\n\n\nLending\n allows users to deposit native L1- asset collateral, and then create a debt at a collateralization ratio CR (collateralization ratio). The debt is always denominated in USD, regardless of what L1 asset the user receives.\n\n\nAll loans have 0% interest, no liquidations, and no expiration. Risk is contained by limits on collateral for each pool, slip-based fees when opening and closing loans, dynamic CR, and a circuit breaker on RUNE supply.\n\n\nWhat Is RUNE?\n\n\nRUNE is the native coin of THORChain with a total supply of 500,000,000. It has four primary use cases within the THORChain ecosystem: settlement, governance, security, and incentives.\u00a0\n\n\nSettlement\n\n\nTHORChain relies on liquidity pools to execute cross-chain token swaps. Liquidity providers need to fund these pools with assets from different chains paired in a 1:1 ratio with RUNE coins.\n\n\nFor a liquidity provider to add liquidity for $1,000 worth of ETH, they must also add $1,000 worth of RUNE. When the pools become unbalanced they are automatically redressed by arbitrageurs who spot the opportunity to make a profit. For example, if Thorchain is lacking a particular coin, rewards for LPs of that coin will increase in proportion to demand. This is thanks to its \nslip-based fees model\n.\n\n\nSo, when you want to swap an asset using THORchain, you must first convert it into RUNE. From there you will receive your chosen asset from its respective asset pool.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nTHORChain relies on the Proof of Bond mechanism.\n\n\nTo become THORNodes, one must first lock anywhere between 500,000 to over 1 million RUNE.\u00a0\n\n\nAt any given time, the network requires the total bonded RUNE to be double the total RUNE locked across liquidity pools (RUNE\u2019s \nbonded:staked = 2:1\n). So, if there is $1 million worth of RUNE across all liquidity pools, the nodes must bond RUNE worth $2 million.\n\n\nIf a node steals assets from the pool, the RUNE they lock up is reduced by the total amount they steal. This leaves no incentive for nodes to act against the network.\n\n\nNew nodes enter and exit the validator set every 3 days \u2013 when the vaults churn. Old validators are forcibly removed, and new validators join. New vault keys are created and all network assets are re-distributed to new vaults, proving network solvency and access to all funds.\n\n\nTHORChain ensures economic security through shifting rewards with the incentive pendulum. If the bond of each node is much greater than the value of the assets in the vaults, rewards shift to liquidity providers \u2013 and vice versa. Fees are distributed to liquidity providers and node operators depending on the balance of security to liquidity, so that assets are never undersecured.\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nNode operators govern network constants through \nmimir\n. When a majority of nodes vote to change a network constant, the value is changed. Nodes can also vote in the \nADR process\n which governs the architecture and direction of the protocol. Liquidity providers can use their RUNE to create new pools on THORChain, which are activated above a certain liquidity threshold.\n\n\nIncentives\n\n\nTHORChain uses RUNE tokens to incentivize liquidity providers via the \nslip-based liquidity model\n for enabling seamless cross-chain token swaps.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the network rewards node operators in RUNE for securing the network. It also subsidizes the nodes for paying the gas for all outgoing transactions.\n\n\nHow to Secure RUNE With Your Ledger\n\n\nTHORChain brings a unique user experience for swapping assets based on different chains. Plus, you can manage your RUNE with absolute confidence by accessing THORChain via the \nLedger Live\n ecosystem.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find everything you need on our supported coins page if you want to \nsecure RUNE with your Ledger\n.\n\n\nTHORChain Brings Interoperability to Swapping\n\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem continues to flourish. But it relies on the ingenuity of developers to overcome its current limitations, and become truly decentralized. This is why projects like THORChain are so important. Not just for their utility to individual users, but for the advancement they enable across the whole crypto ecosystem.\n\n\nWith protocols like THORChain making users the sole custodians of their crypto as they trade, the most important tool in any DeFi trader\u2019s arsenal is their crypto wallet. That\u2019s why keeping your private keys, the keys to your crypto wallet, secure is so important. And of course, the only way to truly secure \nprivate keys\n is by keeping them offline. This is why Ledger hardware wallets should be the baseline for your DeFi interactions.\n\n\n\n"
