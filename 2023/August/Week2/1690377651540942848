        "original_content": "As a blockchain security firm, it\u2019s our natural duty to protect users\u2019 assets\nand safeguard the web3 world for its long-lasting prosperity. However, recent\nevents have led to discussions about the attack alert rule and procedure. We\nfeel called to stand up and openly share our upgraded attack alert policy with\nthe community, with careful consideration about the balance between\ntransparency and trust. 1) The first alert should contain enough information\nto alert the community, including the affected protocol and the number of\npotential losses. This can tell the community who is affected and the severity\nof the attack. In most cases, an attack tx will NOT be included in this alert\n\u2013 to prevent such information from being abused. 2) Actively monitor the\naffected protocols and contact the project with trusted channels to share\ndetailed information, like tx hash and root cause \u2013 to help them fix the\nprotocol. Of course, at the same time, respond to the inquiries from LPs of\naffected protocols and provide necessary help if necessary. 3) Publicly\nrelease the root cause analysis later when the affected contract is safe. Root\ncause analysis is a useful resource for the community. 4) Last but not least,\nwe call on the community to unite together to make the Web3 world safe and\nprosperous. Note that such a policy applies to the attack in the wild. For the\nzero-day vulnerability that has not been exploited, the detailed information\nshould be kept confidential and reported to affected protocols. We understand\ndifferent people may take different perspectives on one thing. And we are open\nto the community's voice and think for the public good."
