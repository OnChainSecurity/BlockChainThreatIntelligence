With this, there is speculation that this liquidity may have caused the recent dip. \n\n#PeckShieldAlert #Shibariumbridge https://t.co/8VyzqRug0G\n\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 17, 2023\nThe Shibarium chain is expected to act as a medium for optimum utilization of dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), TREAT, and the Doge killer, LEASH.\n\nSurprisingly, while the launch was expected to push the price of meme coins up, things went sideways as the tokens plummeted. As of press time, SHIB is down 10%, with the same gong for TREAT, while BONE and LEASH are down a stark 17% and 25% respectively over the last 24 hours. \n\n#PeckShieldAlert $BONE has dropped-17% https://t.co/tktwMsvXCd pic.twitter.com/sj4mGCzCfd\n\n- PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 17, 2023\nWhile the move is disappointing for the many new wallets that joined the network ahead of the Shibarium launch, all hope is not lost, with possibilities of recovery as network users begin reconciling with the change. \n\nMeanwhile, an unconfirmed message from Shytoshi has fueled concern, suggesting it may be impossible to recovery the bridged tokens. \n\nq3 2023\n\ndogged pic.twitter.com/NSP7iLzPUe\n\n- smolting (wassie, verse) (@inversebrah) August 16, 2023\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu price dips over 5% following the launch of Ethereum L2 chain Shibarium\n\nOpen Interest, funding rate FAQs\nHow does Open Interest affect cryptocurrency prices?\nHigher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market.
