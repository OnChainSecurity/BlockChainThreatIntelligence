        "original_content": "EVM Chain: Please Unbox this Security\nSolution? The operation of\na public chain (L1/L2) often faces even more severe risk challenges than on-\nchain protocols. Once a vulnerability arises, it may even potentially\njeopardize the entire ecosystem.\n? However, there are only a\nhandful of companies globally that possess the capability to conduct security\naudits for EVM chains. According to publicly available information, the number\nof companies with relevant experience is even less than 5. To address this\nmarket demand, BlockSec has dedicated efforts to conduct in-depth research and\nhas made the decision to fill this gap.\n? Over the past few months,\nleveraging our profound understanding of EVM chains and virtual machines,\nBlockSec has proactively discovered multiple vulnerabilities and risks in EVM\nchains such as\n\n[@Filecoin](/Filecoin)\n\n,\n\n[@AurorachainEN](/AurorachainEN)\n\n,\n\n[@MoonbeamNetwork](/MoonbeamNetwork)\n\n, earning over $1,300,000 in\n[#BugBounty]. But we didn't stop there!\n??\u200d?BlockSec\nhas developed a dynamic differential fuzzing tool called \"Examiner.\" By\ncomparing the execution result of the EVM compatible solutions against the\ngold model (i.e., Geth) to explore the potential flaws and ensure the\nrobustness, reliability, and security of the EVM implementations. Currently,\nBlockSec's EVM Chain Security Solution (Auditing service + Examiner) has been\nrecognized and adopted by\n\n[@EOSnFoundation](/EOSnFoundation)\n\n, contributing to the security and healthy development of\n[#EOS] ecosystem.\n?\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Inquiry:\ncontact@blocksec.com"
