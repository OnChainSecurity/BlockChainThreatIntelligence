Here are the steps I have taken:\n\nI created a new Hardhat project using npx hardhat.\nI created a deploy.js file in the tasks directory with the following code:\nconst { ethers } = require(\"hardhat\");\n\nasync function deploy() {\n  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();\n  const MaliciousContract = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"contracts/malicious_contracts/MaliciousContract\");\n  const maliciousContract = await MaliciousContract.deploy();\n  await maliciousContract.deployed();\n  console.log(\"MaliciousContract deployed to:\", maliciousContract.address);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = deploy;\nI added the following code to my hardhat.config.js file to specify the location of the tasks directory:\nmodule.exports = {\n  paths: {\n    tasks: \"./tasks\",\n  },\n  // other config options...\n};\nI ran the command npx hardhat --network localhost deploy to deploy the contract.\nExpected Result:\nThe MaliciousContract contract should be deployed to the local blockchain network and its address should be logged to the console.\n\nActual Result:\nI received the following error message:\n\nError HH303: Unrecognized task 'deploy'\n\nFor more info go to https://hardhat.org/HH303 or run Hardhat with --show-stack-traces\nI have tried specifying the full path to the deploy.js file in my command (npx hardhat --network localhost tasks/deploy.js), but I received the same error message. I have also tried running Hardhat with the --debug flag, but I did not see any additional information that would help me identify the issue.\n\nI am using Hardhat version 2.9.3 and Node.js version 14.17.3.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any additional information I can provide to help diagnose this issue. Thank you!\n\n@DangVanSo\nDangVanSo commented on Jun 18\nconst { ethers } = require(\"hardhat\");\n\nasync function deploy() {\nconst [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();\nconst MaliciousContract = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"contracts/malicious_contracts/MaliciousContract\");\nconst maliciousContract = await MaliciousContract.deploy();\nawait maliciousContract.deployed();\nconsole.log(\"MaliciousContract deployed to:\", maliciousContract.address);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = deploy;"
