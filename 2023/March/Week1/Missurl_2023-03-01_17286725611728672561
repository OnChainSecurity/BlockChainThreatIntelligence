        "original_content": "Innovation races ahead at breakneck speeds in the crypto world with each new advancement promising to bridge the gaps of its predecessors. Still, the crypto sphere has not been without its shortcomings.\nBitcoin and Ethereum's scalability issues have been well-documented and often serve as a topic of interest in crypto circles. This scalability bottleneck, together with high transaction fees and slower confirmation times, affects mainstream adoption. These issues created the need for a solution that addresses these problems while preserving crypto's decentralization ethos.\nEnter Arbitrum, which aims to illuminate a path toward a more scalable crypto future.\nIn this Arbitrum review, we will give you the lowdown on everything you should know about this L2.\nWhat Is Arbitrum\nOne of the blockchain projects using \nOptimistic Rollups\n is Arbitrum. Built on top of the Ethereum network (\nLayer 1\n), this is a Layer-2 blockchain, or L2 shortened. Adopting optimistic rollups helps Ethereum solve the scalability issue, thus boosting the throughput for transactions, which in turn lowers the transaction fee as more transactions can be added to the block faster.\nAlthough transactions are processed on Arbitrum via ArbOS, the operating system that handles the transactions and collects fees, security for the transactions is still processed by the Ethereum network. So it's essentially combining the best of both worlds.\nThe consensus mechanism used by Arbitrum to process transactions is known as the \nAnyTrust Guarantee\n. How this works is that all the validators need to agree for a block to be added. As long as there is one validator who disagrees, the block won't be added to the blockchain.\nThe project's primary target audience is developers, as it offers an ETH-friendly environment for them to build DApps without costly fees. There are also various key features of the projects that we will point out in the following sections below.\nArbitrum Rollup\nOne of the ways to distinguish one type of rollup from another is the number of rounds of disputes required to resolve challenges. Arbitrum's version uses the Multi-Round Interactive Optimistic Rollup. An on-chain contract referees the back-and-forth between the challenger and the asserter. In addition, the amount of data on-chain is low.\nEVM-Compatible and Ease of Use\nAnother highlight of Arbitrum is its high compatibility with the \nEthereum Virtual Machine\n (EVM). In a nutshell, the EVM is the \"computer\" that runs the Ethereum network for smart contract execution. Arbitrum has its own\"supercomputer\", known as Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM), that underpins everything that is Arbitrum. On top of the AVM is ArbOS, as mentioned earlier. The AVM supports the EVM architecture. This means that ETH developers can develop on Arbitrum just as if they are developing it on the Ethereum network itself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn this sense, Arbitrum is positioning itself as the \"home-away-from-home\" option for ETH developers. Not only is it compatible with EVM, but it also natively supports all Ethereum development tools without any special add-on. This includes all smart contract languages like Solidity, which works just as well on Arbitrum. Therefore, dApps originally developed in Ethereum can easily move over to Arbitrum with minimal code changes. It's never been easier to move dApps over, making it a most attractive option as the transaction costs are drastically lower than working on the Ethereum network itself.\nBrief History\nThe project had a soft launch in May 2021. By early July, two months later, about 300 DApps were running on it. The mainnet launch, known as Arbitrum One, was launched on Aug. 31, 2021.\nArbitrum Ecosystem\nL2s currently have a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $10.68 billion with Ethereum claiming over half of the total.\nL2s Currently Have TVL of $10.68 Billion. Image via \nL2Beat\nTVL for Arbitrum One, the Optimistic Rollup, stood at $5.84 billion. That's more than half the market share! This goes to show the popularity and belief of the Ethereum developer community.\nArbitrum One's TVL was $5.84 billion as of Sept. 29. Image via \nL2Beat\nNow, let's see what kind of DApps are on Arbitrum.\n\"Your portal to discover the Arbitrum ecosystem\" is the first thing you see when you are at the \nArbitrum Portal\n. There are two categories to choose from: Projects and Bridge.\nProjects\nThis lets you explore over 600 DApps in the Arbitrum ecosystem. According to \nDefiLlama\n, the top-10 DApps on Arbitrum all have to do with DeFi. However, there are a few interesting ones as well, per \nDAppRadar\n.\nIn \nWeb3 gaming\n, there's HunnyPlay, SpartaDEX and MODragon.\nZKasino, JustBet and BetSwirl are listed in the \ngambling\n category.\nPost.Tech, Galxe and QuestN are among the top \nsocial DApps\n on Arbitrum.\nBridge\nThe Arbitrum Bridge facilitates the transfer of assets between Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova (an an AnyTrust chain) and the Ethereum mainnet.\nOffchain Labs\nThe team building Arbitrum carries an impressive resum\u00e9. Based in New York, prior experiences range from Deputy US CTO at the White House and senior Advisor to the President (\nEd Felten\n) to co-author of the leading textbook in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies (\nSteve Goldfeder\n) to technical consulting for cryptocurrency projects. In addition, many rank-and-file employees are also crypto-enthusiasts and have their areas of interest in the crypto-verse.\nThey have managed to secure funding with major well-known ventures in the blockchain space. Major investors include \nLightspeed\n, \nPantera\n and \nPolychain Capital\n. Together with other VCs such as Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain, Fenbushi Capital, and Mark Cuban Companies, to name a few, a total of $120 million of series B funding was raised for the venture.\nWith this amount of institutional support, it's safe to say that Arbitrum is no fly-by-night operation, and the calibre of its team is proof of its staying power in the crypto world. They're also looking to expand their team to cater for their dramatic growth.\nArbitrum Reddit Project\nOne of the more exciting projects the Offchain Labs team was involved in was a collaboration with Reddit. When Reddit decided to launch its ERC-20 token, known as Community Points, to its members, it had a \"Scaling Bake Off\" to pick the best blockchain for collaboration. Arbitrum beat out 21 other competitors to win the competition. Reddit users earn these tokens by providing quality comments or contributing in other ways. The tokens can be spent on items within the Reddit ecosystem.\nArbitrum Token Airdrop\nIn March 2023, Arbritum released ARB, its governance token. The airdrop was hugely successful, distributing over 1 billion tokens. Before the launch, daily transactions increased from 300k to over 2.7 million on the day of the airdrop, and active users increased from 100,000 to over 600,000.\nContributors to the Arbitrum TVL were: -\nGMX\n: A decentralized perpetual exchange\u00a0\nUniswap V3\n: A liquidity provider\nArbritum Exchange\nSushi\n: A DAO\nArbitrum had a $1.62 billion total value locked (TVL) in January 2023. However, by March 31, \nTVL was over $2 billion\n and, according to Arbitrum website's, TVL stood at $5.5 billion as of Aug. 31.\nArbitrum Continues With Impressive Growth. Image via \nArbitrum\nArbritum has an over $1 billion market cap, with a fully diluted value of more than 9 billion\nArbitrum ARB has a total supply of 10 billion, and CoinGecko lists ARB as the 41st largest coin by market cap.\nARB is The 41st Largest Coin By Market Cap. Image via \nCoinGecko\nARB hit an all-time high of $8.67 in March 2023 but gave up those gains in September 2023, when it cratered to its all-time low.\nAs we move out of the bear market, it will be interesting to see how ARB performs.\u00a0\nArbitrum Technology Upgrades\nNitro\nIn August 2022, Arbitrum launched the Nitro upgrade. The improvements over the original Arbitrum include the following:\nReduced transaction costs: By lowering the amount of data posted to layer 1, the average fee to send Ethereum (ETH) on Arbitrum is $0.25.\nNitro upgrade increased performance for layer 1 nodes.\nEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility.\nAdditional layer 1 interoperability\nGeth trading for better debugging support and high compatibility with Ethereum by \u201ccompiling in the core code of Geth (go-Ethereum).\u201d\n\"Geth (go-ethereum) is a Go implementation of Ethereum - a gateway into the decentralized web. Geth has been a core part of Ethereum since the very beginning. Geth was one of the original Ethereum implementations making it the most battle-hardened and tested client.\" Source: \nGeth Ethereum\nNitro has a two-phase strategy for processing transactions, beginning with a single-order sequence and processing by a deterministic state transition function in that sequence.\nArbitrum also wanted to separate execution from proving. Nitro compiles the same source code twice: -\nExecuted for speed in a Nitro node to native code.\nTo WASM for use in optimising security and portability and proving\nNitro uses an optimistic roll-up protocol to settle transactions in the layer 1 Ethereum chain (with interactive fraud proofs)\u00a0\nArbitrum One and Nova are powered by Nitro, our proprietary blockchain network-powered technology stack. Nitro\u2019s next-generation rollup architecture provides 7x more throughput than Ethereum and lower fees without sacrificing any security. (Source: Arbitrum)\nRollups are a layer 2 solution that bundles transaction data and transfers it off a main chain. Transactions are executed off-chain, and assets are held in a smart contract on-chain.\u00a0\nHow Transactions Are Processed In Nitro. Image via \nArbitrum\nA primary benefit of Arbitrum is its super-fast transaction speeds (TPS).\u00a0\nEthereum averages around 30 TPS, compared to a staggering 40,000 TPS for Arbitrum transactions. Faster transactions equal lower fees. Ethereum transactions can cost several dollars compared to around two cents for Arbitrum.\u00a0\nArbitrum Nova: AnyTrust Chain\nArbitrum launched Nova in July 2022, which uses AnyTrust technology.\nAnyTrust protocol accepts a mild trust assumption by relying upon an external committee. Regardless of how many people are on the Committee, AnyTrust works on the belief that at least two people are honest. Subsequently, when given access to data, one of the parties must be trustworthy so that the available data ensures the rollup functions correctly.\nArbitrum Nova provides high security with low transaction costs and helps DApps that want to reduce high transaction costs.\u00a0\nGas Fees Are Ultra Low On Arbritum Compared With Ethereum Fees: Image Source: \nArbitrum Nova\nNova's use cases include the following:\nGame Developers: To enable increased functionality for users.\nSocial Projects: The Reddit Community point system was built on Nova.\nBlockchain DApps. Suitable for multiple use cases, such as NFT ecosystems\nNova has \"strong security guarantees using a DAC (Data Availability Committee) model). Committee members include the following list of well-known companies: -\nReddit\nConsensys\nQuicknode\nOffchain Labs\nGoogle Cloud\n\"Nova is powered by the most trusted organizations across web2 and Web3.\" (Source: Arbitrum)\nArbitrum Presents Multiple Benefits: Image Source: \nArbitrum Nova\nTo learn more about AnyTrust technology, visit Arbritum's \nDeveloper AnyTrust page.\nArbitrum Stylus\nArbitrum announced the launch of Stylus in February 2023 as a next-generation \"programming environment upgrade for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\"\u00a0\nStylus technology is interoperable with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It enables the deployment of smart contracts in programming languages like C++, C and Rust to Arbitrum One and Nova, alongside Solidarity DApps on existing EVM programs.\u00a0\n\"You won't have to know Solidity to build on Arbitrum. Engineers can use the tooling they already know and love, regardless of their coding preferences.\" (Source: \nArbitrum Medium\n).\nStylus enables lower fees and faster DApps. Stylus technology means that a contract does not need to know what language others use. It has multiple use cases, such as DeFi, gaming, DAOs, and many more can benefit from the data saving costs and increased performance.\nUsers compile their programs into WASM, transforming on-chain into an enforced, secure execution.\nWASM is an abbreviation of WebAssembly.\u00a0\n\"WASM defines a portable binary-code format and a corresponding text format for executable programs as well as software interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment. WebAssembly. Paradigm. Structured; stack machine.\" (Source: \nWikipedia\n)\nStylus enables the termination of malicious programs without evoking the EVM and can be proven on-chain.\n\"Stylus doesn't replace the EVM; it augments it. Everything we are doing is entirely additive, which is why we call it EVM+.\" (Source: \nArbitrum Medium\n).\nTop Projects On Arbitrum\nHundreds of projects have partnered with Arbitrum, from DeFi lending, crypto wallets, NFT platforms, stablecoins, infrastructure and much more.\u00a0\nSuperfluid: DeFi Primitive\nToFu NFT: NFT Marketplace\nAave: DeFi Lending Platform\nCurve: Decentralised exchange\nCoinbase Wallet: Crypto Wallet\nHuobi Wallet: Multi-chain wallet\nDev Protocol: Middleware Protocol\nSynapse: Cross-Chain Layer Protocol\nFarmland: Decentralised Farming Game\nFluidFi: Tokensised Equity in Fluid Finance\nAbracadabra: Interest Bearing Crypto Assets for Collateral\u00a0\nTo view all projects, visit the \nArbiproject\n website.\nRisk & Pain Points\nAs much of a powerhouse as Arbitrum has been with its success, it is not without some weaknesses. Here are two key areas to pay attention to:\nOptimistic vs zkRollups\nThe design of optimistic rollups involves a challenge period, which can be up to 2 weeks, as it gives people ample opportunity to check that all blocks are actual transactions. For those who want to withdraw their tokens, this can be a long wait time before getting their tokens back. Here is where zkRollups shine.\nUnlike Optimistic rollups with the challenge period, \nzkRollups\n, also known as zero-knowledge Rollups, generate a validity proof known as SNARK to validate the authenticity of the transactions. SNARK contains only key details of the transaction, not the complete data. This rollup method does not require a challenge period, which makes moving funds around a lot faster.\nIf you want to dive deeper into the Layer 2 scaling race, check out our in-depth analysis of \nArbitrum vs. Optimism and ZkSync.\nFund Security\nAccording to \nL2Beat\n, a website that compares L2 projects together with analysis, there are a few ways that the security of funds can be compromised on Arbitrum, including, but not limited to:\nMistakes in the AVM implementation could lead to lost funds.\nThe centralised validator going down, which means users cannot create new blocks. However, exiting the system requires a new block to be produced. In this case, funds can be frozen. This \nrecently happened\n due to the current centralised structure.\nNo delays in code upgrades might mean that a malicious code can slip in without knowing. This kind of incident could result in stolen funds.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConclusion\u00a0\nIn 2021, we saw the rise of L1 alternatives like \nSolana\n, \nAvalanche\n and \nFantom\n chomping away at Ethereum's market share. These L1s honed in on Ethereum's weaknesses and jumpstarted their ecosystems of DApps to provide an alternative to Ethereum's offerings. These alternative L1s may have gotten a headstart with faster transaction speed and low-cost fees, but is it as secure as Ethereum? They also have their growing pains to contend with, as can be seen with Solana's on-off outages in the past few months\nIn the space of L2s, Arbitrum is the top dog and the one to beat. How long it can retain its winning crown depends on its development pace to secure the blockchain. \nNews of a bug\n causing a 7-hour outage within five months of another bug is not something it wants to be known for.\nThere is talk that L1s will mainly be for the bots in the future as humans will likely be interacting with DApps built on L2s. When you think of it, internet users don't need to know about IP addresses or website domain hosting to shop online or check their email.\u00a0\nIt is highly plausible in the not-so-distant future that things like gas fees and which blockchain is hosting the DApps will be of no interest to the general public as these friction/touchpoints will already have been ironed out or \"rolled up\" under a slick UI and compelling service/ product. When that time comes, Arbitrum will only be a brand name known to developers but largely unknown to the general public.\nWe look forward to watching Arbitrum progress over the next few years."
