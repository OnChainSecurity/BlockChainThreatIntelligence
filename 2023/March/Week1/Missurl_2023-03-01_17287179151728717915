        "original_content": "\n\nThe blockchain security company \u2013 PeckShield \u2013 outlined that wrongdoers siphoned $211.5 million worth of cryptocurrencies last month via 26 attacks.\n\n\nThe Euler Finance exploit accounted for the bigger part of the amount after hackers stole $197 million in staked ETH, USDC, wrapped BTC, and DAI.\n\n\nMarch Was Not All Sunshine and Roses\n\n\nThe \nrevival\n of the cryptocurrency market last month and the rising prices of many digital assets seemed like great news for investors and proponents of the industry. However, that momentum coincided with an increase in hacking attacks.\n\n\nAs revealed by PeckShield, cyber criminals drained more than $211 million worth of crypto in March, a significant increase compared to the $35.3 million lost in February.\n\n\nThe Euler Finance exploit that resulted in almost $200 million in digital assets being siphoned accounted for over 93% of the total stash. Decentralized finance (DeFi) project SafeMoon \nranked\n\u00a0second with $8.7 million in losses, while $5.2 million departed from ParaSpace.\u00a0\n\n\nAttacks on General Bytes ATM ($1.7 million), Tender.fi ($1.58 million), and Swerve Finance ($1.3 million) also comprised the full picture.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe Euler Finance Drama\n\n\nThe DeFi lending protocol made the headlines in the middle of March after hackers breached its security and \nembezzled\n\u00a0nearly $200 million in crypto assets. The wrongdoer borrowed a substantial amount of money through Euler\u2019s platform and later drained the tokens in a so-called flash loan attack.\n\n\nShortly after, the entity\u00a0\noffered\n the perpetrator to keep approximately $20 million if they returned the remaining funds. They were reluctant to accept the deal and instead mixed the crypto in Tornado Cash just a few hours after the proposal was made public.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, the hacker behind the exploit, going by the name \u201cJacob,\u201d changed their stance towards the end of the month, sending back over $100 million worth of ETH to the protocol.\u00a0\nThey went even further in the following days, \napologizing\n for the crime and returning more assets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL OFFER (Sponsored)\n\n\nBinance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive): \nUse this link\n to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance\n (\nfull details\n).\n\nLIMITED OFFER 2024 at BYDFi Exchange: Up to $2,888 welcome reward, \nuse this link\n to register and open a 100 USDT-M position for free!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
