        "original_content": "\n\nTardfiwhale, a pseudonymous blockchain investigator, has raised concerns about potential critical flaws in Ethena, a rising synthetic dollar stablecoin protocol. The sleuth, known for predicting the fall of Luna and UST, has been alerting about these alleged flaws since March 15, warning that users could \"lose a lot of money\" due to the current operation of the protocol.\n\nHowever, Tardfiwhale is not revealing these flaws for free. He initially requested $500,000 in donations, half of which would go to Protocol Guild, a group of Ethereum developers, and the rest divided between crypto researcher Zachxbt and the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers facing money laundering charges. On March 18, the bounty was increased to $1 million due to the involvement of Maker and Mantle in Ethena.\n\nTardfiwhale stated that this is his chance to give back and prevent another disaster like those caused by UST, FTX, Celsius, etc. He emphasized that revealing these flaws would not benefit him personally. Meanwhile, Ethena is preparing to airdrop 750 million ENA, its governance token, and recently announced a campaign to include bitcoin as a backing asset.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#altcoins\n \n#ethena\n \n#bitcoin\n \n#blockchain\n \n#stablecoin\n \n#analysis\n \n#cryptostan\n \n#thecryptocountry\n\n\n\n\n\n"
