        "original_content": "In March 2023, Paraspace was attacked. Luckily, we managed a rescue in the\nnick of time, recovering all losses: 2906 Ether. In this long tweet, I reveal\nan insider story of the rescue without giving you any headaches tech details.\nMore importantly, I want to show you how essential real-world combat is to a\ndefense system. Paraspace is a top NFT lending protocol on Ethereum. For any\nlending protocol, ensuring collateral value is higher than lent funds is key.\nMany attacks on lending protocol manipulate the collateral value, and this\nattack on Paraspace was no exception. On March 17, 2023, the attacker deployed\nthe attack contract and completed the setup. He made three unsuccessful\nattacks from 3:51:23 UTC to 4:36:23 UTC. Post-analysis revealed the attacker's\nmain failure was due to the 'Gas Limit' not being enough to execute this\n\u201ccomplex\u201d attack. During the three failed attacks, the attacker was gradually\nincreasing the gas limit, and by the third attempt, they were very close to\nsuccess. (Gas Limit: 6,721,975 -> 9,000,000 -> 13,000,000) Luckily for us\nthree failed transactions used up the funds he had prepared for the attack.\nNow he needed to found some more funds to continue the attack. That gave us\nsome time. We detected the attack when the attacker send the first tx, even\nthough the tx failed. However, due to a significant upgrade, Phalcon had an\nerror processing this complex transaction, which caused us some trouble. We\nhad to deal with issues ASPA. Finally, at 5:47:11 UTC on March 17, 2023, our\nrescue contract was ready. With no time to hesitate, we immediately sent the\nrescue transaction and successfully saved 2906 Ether.\n[https://explorer.phalcon.xyz/tx/eth/0xe3f0d14cfb6076cabdc9057001c3fafe28767a192e88005bc37bd7d385a1116a\u2026](https://t.co/91oVv0eIcy)\nBetween the race against time, if the attacker had given one more try, he\nwould have won, and we would have lost. But at the end of the race, we won! An\nimpressive side note was that we upgraded the Phalcon system to support\ninternal call analysis(like JUMP). But this attack tx is too 'complex' and led\nto a data explosion, resulting in our node's crash. We detected this abnormal\ntransaction immediately but can't automatically block it. We were distraught!\nThankfully, we managed the situation in time, but the memory of the race\nagainst time still lingers. This episode proves once again how fragile systems\nthat have not been battle-tested are. I'm writing this story not to brag, but\nwant to tell you that we have confidence in Phalcon Block. It's not a toy.\nIt's a powerful weapon made for crypto community. It has been battle-tested\nfor over a year and with successful records to prove itself. Let Phalcon Block\nbuild a defense line for your protocol. There is no extra risk, it's just like\na shield that only provides one more defense line and one more safety.
