        "original_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nA Fortune report on the 20th of March revealed the ongoing investigation by the SEC (United States Securities and Exchange Commission) into the Ethereum foundation to conclude Ethereum as a Security. According to the Cointelegraph news, the foundation had presented some indirect indication for a disclosed investigation.\u00a0\n\n\nSEC Targets US-Based Companies\n\n\nSEC has connected with three prominent US-based companies to collect documents and financial records against the Ethereum foundation to classify Ethereum as Security. This information is made public by many well-known personalities in the industry. The interaction with these companies is said to be a part of the campaign to declare Ethereum as security.\n\n\n\n\nAn anonymous office employee has confirmed that the investigation had begun briefly after the merge happened in 2022. Back then Ethereum shifted from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\u00a0\n\n\nGary Gensler\n, the SEC head, failed to answer the question on the classification of Ethereum. There\u2019s no clear answer from the SEC on Ethereum as to whether it\u2019s a Security or Commodity. It is one of the factors delaying Ethereum Spot ETF approval.\n\n\nAlso Read: \nEthereum Price is Up 12%; Why is ETH Price Rising Today?\n\n\nIn a 2018 statement, Gary made a statement classifying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others as \u201cNot securities\u201d but has now changed it to the statement without a definitive answer.\u00a0\n\n\nSEC\u2019s Stance On Ethereum ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability of \nSpot ETH ETF\n approval is reducing over time. Last month, the analyst\u2019s prediction guaranteed a 50% chance of approval by the SEC in May. But by the previous week\u2019s analysis, that has changed to less than 35% chances.\n\n\n\n\nThe delay in this decision is associated with \nGary Gensler\u2019s\n unclear decision about Ethereum being a security or commodity. The silence over this topic points towards the negative news for the Ethereum supporters.\u00a0\n\n\nDespite all this confusion, the ETF tied to \nETH futures\n has been approved by the commission, but the approval for Spot Ethereum ETFs has been on hold for months. The final response on that has been shifted to May now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis SEC behavior is despised among the crypto community and by the United States Representative French Hill. During testimony on Wednesday, Congressman French Hill (R-LA) alleged that the SEC, under Gensler\u2019s guidance, had \u201cblatantly and repeatedly\u201d exceeded \u201cits statutory authority.\u201d\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\nThe ongoing drama with SEC over the Ethereum Spot ETF looks more severe over time with the chance of rejection of the ETF. The analysts have also talked of the same where earlier it was called to be a done deal because of the popularity of \nBitcoin Spot ETF\n, but with the continuous delays, the expectation has been lowered. The new date for the ruling on Spot ETH ETF is said to be in May. All we can do is wait to see how the SEC decision will roll out at that time.\u00a0\n\n\nRead more about \nBitcoin Price Bounce Back With Fed Meeting: Will Crypto Market Recover?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       \nEzra Icy, the creative wizard from Phoenix, Arizona, specializes in crafting magnetic content for Web3 brands.
