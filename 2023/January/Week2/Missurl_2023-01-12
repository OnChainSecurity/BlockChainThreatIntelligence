The scammers will use wallet addresses generated from vanity address generators and match the first and last characters of their victim\u2019s wallet address. This gets unsuspecting users to send their funds to the wrong copycat address.\n\n\nWhile the attempt would not give the hackers access to user wallets, people who may have gotten into the habit of copying their wallet address from the transaction history before sending digital asset balances could potentially send their funds to copycat addresses. \n\nRelated: Nomad exploit wallet address transfers $1.5M to Tornado Cash\n\nBecause of this, the wallet provider warned users to always be careful and double-check their transactions before sending their balances.
