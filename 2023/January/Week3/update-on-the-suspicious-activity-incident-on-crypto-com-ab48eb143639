The majority of these stolen funds (4,830 Ether) were subsequently passed through transaction privacy/mixer-like service Tornado Cash.\n\nBITCOIN\n\nLikewise, we have noticed similar suspicious withdrawals on the Bitcoin Chain with respect to Crypto.com\u2019s BTC wallet (bc1q7cyrfmck2ffu2ud3rn5l5a8yv6f0chkp0zpemf).\n\nThe BTC involved in these suspicious withdrawals were observed to have been aggregated to a single fresh wallet bc1qk8wlwypvvr6v5lmsngg5a248k2a9cgrsrw5jsq too, where the BTC is currently sitting. This aggregation was done over a single transaction (be53bf20b2fdeb733e17cf9dcdea1f42761486f178711cd679fdf6b19c970ad1), from a total of 162 other wallets, amounting to a total of 172.93225 BTC.\n\nThese 162 wallets look to involve the same suspicious withdrawal transaction patterns we saw earlier on the Ethereum Chain:\n\nReceived funds from Crypto.com\u2019s BTC wallet across multiple transactions with similar amounts.\nAll wallets are new.\nAbout Uppsala Security\n\nUppsala Security built Sentinel Protocol, the first crowdsourced Threat Intelligence Platform powered by artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and machine learning.
