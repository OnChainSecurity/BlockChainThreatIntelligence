Investment or business opportunity scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment or business opportunity scams often begin with an\n unsolicited offer\n,\n \ntypically to become a\n cryptocurrency investor\n, that lures you to a\n fraudulent website\n to learn more about the apparent opportunity. Once on the site, you\u2019re encouraged to invest and make money quickly. The website might even have celebrity endorsements or testimonials that are fake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut once you complete your transaction, the offer never comes to fruition, and you don\u2019t see your money again. You might equate these types of cryptocurrency scams to multi-level marketing schemes or Ponzi schemes. They\u2019re called \npig butchering scams\n because the butcher (the scammer) fattens up their account by getting you to invest more money over time before disappearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Imposter or impersonation scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn imposter or impersonation scam is when a cybercriminal poses as a \ntrusted source\n to convince victims to complete a cryptocurrency transaction. This might be under the disguise of government authorities, credit card providers, banks, a service provider, or even a fake celebrity, and they\u2019ll often reach out via email and request you complete payment via cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, the government does not regulate cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s also not yet widely accepted by businesses, so you should exercise caution whenever you receive email requests for crypto payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor safe measure, double-check with the source through a different communication channel and \nverify a website\u2019s security\n before completing a transaction.\n\n\n3. Blackmail or extortion scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the oldest scamming approaches in the book, blackmail, or extortion, is when you receive a message that someone has\n compromising information \nabout you\u2014be it photos, videos, confidential data, etc.\u2014and they request you pay them money or else they\u2019ll release it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis becomes a cryptocurrency scam when the scammer requests the payment in crypto, oftentimes because the victim can\u2019t reverse the transactions and because of the anonymity cryptocurrency offers. That complexity and anonymity make it tough for law enforcement to track fraudulent payments. It\u2019s best to delete these messages and report the sender to authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media cryptocurrency scams are just what they sound like: cryptocurrency scams that occur over social media. Oftentimes, this is via a false social media post or advertisement requesting payment in cryptocurrency. You might even see other users responding to the post or leaving reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, these could be bots trying to lure you into a \nsocial media scam\n. The post or message might be from a friend whose account got hacked. Alternatively, social media influencers might tout new and potentially fake crypto and encourage users to sign up or send them payments that they might multiply. In some cases, influencers merely pocket the payments. These are referred to as \ninfluencer cryptocurrency scams\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom line:\n Recognize that cryptocurrency isn\u2019t a widely used payment method, and any pushy requests to pay with crypto are likely a scam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Giveaway cryptocurrency scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat of a cross between impersonation and social media cryptocurrency scams, giveaway scams are when cybercriminals lure victims into sending them money while promising they\u2019ll multiply the payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, this could occur if a fake celebrity social media account posts that if followers send them a certain amount of cryptocurrency, they will send back twice the amount. In fact, followers will send money directly to scammers, never to see their investment again.\n\n\n6. Fake apps\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a digital payment method, \ndifferent cryptocurrencies also have different apps, and cybercriminals can be skilled at replicating them\n. In 2021, there were \nover 300,000\n downloads of a fake app that stole banking credentials from victims. Once users download these \nfake apps\n, they might begin sending payments directly to the crypto scammer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Loader or load-up cryptocurrency scams\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, \nsome cryptocurrency scams will ask for your account logins outright\n. This is how a loader or load-up cryptocurrency scam works: Scammers might ask victims to borrow their account because they need higher limits. In return, the scammer promises to give them a portion of the proceeds from their investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut those returns never materialize. Instead, the scammers load up victims\u2019 accounts and drain them, taking all of the cryptocurrency for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: \nYou should never provide your account logins to someone else, even if you think it\u2019s someone you can trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Romance cryptocurrency scams\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomance scams\n pull on victims\u2019 heartstrings by way of \nsocial engineering tactics\n. How does it work? Cybercriminals play the part of an online love interest and gain a victim\u2019s trust before asking them to send money.\n \nOnce the victim does, the cybercriminal pockets the funds and runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomance cryptocurrency scams follow the same approach, but the funds are requested in cryptocurrency and are much more difficult to reverse.\n\n\n9. Phishing cryptocurrency scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother old-school cyberattack, \nphishing\n scams often occur over email and involve an ask for money. These messages are usually from cybercriminals posing as trusted sources, meaning phishing scams are similar to impersonation scams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of phishing cryptocurrency scams, the false request for payment is in the form of cryptocurrency. The messages might even be from a cybercriminal posing as a cryptocurrency company touting an initial coin offering (ICO) to appear authentic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Employment scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to investment or business opportunity scams, \nemployment scams\n involving cryptocurrency\n \noften begin with\n \nan\n unsolicited job offer \nthat lures victims to a \nfraudulent website\n to learn more about the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will often ask victims to pay for training in cryptocurrency to become fully onboarded to a company. Once the victim makes the payment, the scammer will cut off all contact, having pocketed the money while never having had a real job to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Flash loan attack scams\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a flash loan attack, a cybercriminal will take out an \nunsecured loan\n using a loan protocol to \nshift the market\n in favor of that cryptocurrency. These loan protocols work quickly, so scammers have to be able to take out these loans, siphon off the profits, and then dump the coin back into the market, lowering the value.\n\n\n12. Bitcoin mining scams\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a bitcoin mining scam, also called a cloud cryptocurrency mining scam, \nsomeone offers to rent you computing power located at a data center that they claim is designed to mine cryptocurrency efficiently\n. In their sales pitch, they\u2019ll say that the amount you earn from mining will pay for the rental several times over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that isn\u2019t true. Either the rental will never earn you any money, or the criminal will use it to mine cryptocurrency for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency is hot. Between August 2021 and August 2023, the number of cryptocurrencies available worldwide grew by over \n3,000\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs these new currencies have gained mainstream recognition, scammers have found ways to make money by \ncreating fake cryptocurrencies\n (or creating the illusion of a new currency) \nor hyping an existing currency\n by offering buyers a chance to get in on the ground floor of an ICO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce they have enough investors, they will disappear with all of the \u201cinvested\u201d funds, leaving investors with nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. NFT scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets that can represent real or digital goods and whose ownership is recorded in a \nblockchain\n. In the last several years, there has been a huge explosion in the amount of NFTs created and sold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these NFTs are legitimate and allow people to buy unique artwork or other assets, but\n \nsome \nscammers have used NFTs\n to \ntake advantage of investors\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe on the lookout for anyone offering NFTs with guaranteed growth\u2014like any investment, there are no guarantees. Be sure to double-check the background of NFTs, as some people create elaborate stories about artists to increase sales and drive up prices artificially.\u00a0\n\n\nWarning signs of cryptocurrency fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve learned some background on the most common cryptocurrency scams, it\u2019s time to learn how to spot them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the main cryptocurrency scam red flags to look out for:\n\n\n\n\nToo good to be true: \nThe offer seems too good to be true\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGet rich quick\u201d: \nAlleged guarantees that you\u2019ll get rich quick\n\n\nSketchy website: \nA website\u2019s address bar does not begin with \u201cHTTPS\u201d\n\n\nUrgency and threats: \nThe payment request is urgent and/or includes threatening messages or unnatural urgency\n\n\nThere\u2019s no white paper: \nWhite papers show that proper due diligence has been completed\n\n\nPayment requested in cryptocurrency:\n Businesses and government agencies don\u2019t ask for payment in crypto\n\n\nInfluencer advertising: \nA social media user asks you to pay for something using cryptocurrency\n\n\nOverenthusiastic reviews:\n Reviews can be faked to present a better image of a company\n\n\nYour account logins are requested:\n Some scammers offer to pay you using your accounts but will instead steal your cryptocurrency\n\n\nUnsolicited offers: \nThis could include job offers that require crypto payments for onboarding or offers of favors if you let someone use your cryptocurrency account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to not underestimate crypto scammers and their devious tactics. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve been able to see some success in recent years.\n\n\nHow to avoid cryptocurrency scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know how to spot a cryptocurrency scam, you can stop a cryptocurrency scam.

Bank on these pointers to invest with confidence and keep a Cyber Safety state of mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto scam success rates and takeaways\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that they\u2019re not government-regulated, cryptocurrencies can sometimes feel like the Wild West of the web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further perspective, in early 2023, the \nInternational Monetary Fund\n found that trillions of dollars of value in cryptocurrencies have been lost following platform collapses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween October 2021 and August 2022, \nnearly 46,000\n people lost crypto assets totaling $1 billion. This amounted to a reported median loss of $2,600. Here are a few more trends indicated by data and some key takeaways about how these scams work.\n\n\nYoung investors are prime targets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, younger \ndigital generations\n have embraced cryptocurrency quicker than most. As such, they\u2019ve also become more susceptible to crypto fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the \nFTC\n:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPeople between the ages of 20 and 49 are more than five times more likely to lose money to cryptocurrency scams than older age groups.\n\n\nPeople in their 20s and 30s lose the most money to investment scams, more than half of which is in cryptocurrency losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpersonation cryptocurrency scams work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that impersonations work when it comes to cryptocurrency scams\u2014especially if you\u2019re impersonating Elon Musk, once a big proponent of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency scam victims have \nsent over $2 million\n to Elon Musk impersonators. When looking at imposter scams as a whole, 14% of reported losses are in cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just celebrity impersonations that work, though. Cybercriminals have also posed as\n\nthe Social Security Administration, resulting in the Office of the Inspector General issuing a \nwarning\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto scams rely on emotions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomance scams have long been a successful cyberattack. Nowadays, scams that pull on people\u2019s heartstrings involve pulling money out of their cryptocurrency wallets more than ever. \nTwenty percent of romance scam victims lose money through cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways research before investing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs new cryptocurrency types continue to emerge, it\u2019s important to vet cryptocurrency exchanges before investing your time and money in them. This means:\n\n\n\n\nQuestioning exchanges you haven\u2019t heard of before\n\n\nResearching whether an exchange has been associated with scams or complaints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate how transparent exchanges are about their liquidity and ICO rules\u2014a sign of a reliable company. That might even mean reaching out to the exchange directly and asking. You should also verify if an exchange uses blockchain technology, which helps secure your transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: Nothing has to be paid in cryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest red flags of a cryptocurrency scam is receiving requests for cryptocurrency payments. \nRemember, cryptocurrency is not entirely government-regulated and is not yet widely accepted by businesses, so you should never have to pay in cryptocurrency. If someone, even a trusted online connection, insists you must, that\u2019s a major warning sign of a scam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnore urgent requests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially if they\u2019re unsolicited, \nurgent payment requests are a major red flag of cryptocurrency scams\n. It\u2019s best to delete these requests right when they hit your inbox or mark them as spam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an authority or loved one needs a payment from you urgently, they will find a way to reach you\u2014and they likely won\u2019t request that you pay in cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe wary of get-rich-quick scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be tempting to jump at a get-rich-quick opportunity. But when it comes to cryptocurrency, \nremember that cryptocurrency itself is an investment\n. Generally, any unsolicited opportunities that come to you with \u201cguarantees\u201d or \u201cpromises\u201d for you to make money are a get-scammed-quick opportunity. It\u2019s best to avoid these proposals at all costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport suspicious activity immediately\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think you\u2019re being targeted by a cryptocurrency scam,\n reporting it can keep cryptocurrency exchanges safe for all users\n. There are a few places you can do this:\n\n\nStart using security software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to completely eliminate the risk of falling for a cryptocurrency scam, taking the proactive measure of using security software like \nNorton 360 with LifeLock Select\n is one step that can help reduce the likelihood of being impacted by these scams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp keep your money and personal information safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorton 360 with LifeLock Select\n can help protect your devices and personal information from scammers and stop malicious software before it can do harm.

If you buy from a trusted exchange, use a safe wallet, and do everything you can to spot and avoid scams, crypto is generally pretty safe. But because the industry is unregulated and the value of cryptocurrency changes so much, it\u2019s not as safe an investment as you may be led to believe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to record and verify all transactions on a decentralized, unregulated system called a blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is cryptocurrency different from the U.S. dollar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency differs from the U.S. dollar in that crypto is:\n\n\n\n\nUnregulated by governments\n\n\nQuite volatile in value\n\n\nA system that uses blockchain ledgers and cryptography to record and verify transactions\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I recover scammed cryptocurrency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are a few avenues to recover scammed cryptocurrency, the chance of actually recovering stolen or scammed cryptocurrency is extremely low. Those who lose crypto assets in a scam can report their case to the FTC. You could also contact the crypto exchange company you used to complete the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you get scammed if someone sends you crypto?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Someone sending you a crypto offer (especially if you don\u2019t know them well) could send you to a site designed to phish your personal information or financial logins or install malware on your device.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
