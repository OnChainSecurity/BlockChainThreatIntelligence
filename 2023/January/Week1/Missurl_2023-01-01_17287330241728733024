New addresses can be used for each attack, and this is crucial because wallet security providers rely on previously held data to flag potentially malicious transactions. If the address has no dodgy history, it's likely the transaction will evade these detections.\n\n\nThe fact that attackers can set up a contract before deploying it (before it even exists), using a wallet address that doesn't have a history of malicious activity, means that if they can get the victim to approve a contract they can drain their funds.\n\n\nOf course, this requires some social engineering hijinkery to pull off, but we've all heard about the real-life scam stories that sound too wild to be true, but are. This attack works, and has facilitated huge single-transaction scams in recent times.\n\n\nThe researchers highlighted one fraud in January that saw attackers make off with $3.6 million worth of SuperVerse tokens in one fell swoop as an example of how serious these incidents can be for victims.\n\n\nRemember: with blockchains, there is no legal recourse and no customer helpline to recover funds. Once they're sent and signed, that's it \u2013 tokens are gone for good.\n\n\nHow they work and why they work\n\n\nThe attack flow is as follows. First, an attacker needs to get a victim to approve a contract that hasn't yet been deployed \u2013 the bit that requires social engineering. They then use CREATE2's ability to generate new contract addresses to receive the funds and deploy the malicious contract, complete with the victim's authorization, in turn draining the victim's wallet.\n\n\nThe key part here is the generation of a new wallet address, one that has no history of being reported for criminal intentions. CREATE2 generates this using a calculation that includes four parameters: the attacker's wallet address, a constant prefix, a salt, and an initialization code.\n\n\nThis address will be created only when the victim approves the contract, meaning it's never been used before for any illicit dealings, and won't be used again, thereby bypassing the security protections that usually monitor such transactions.\n\n\n\"The exploitation of the CREATE2 function underscores the continuous battle between innovation and security in the blockchain sphere,\" \nsaid\n Check Point researchers Oded Vanunu, Dikla Barda, and Roman Zaikin.\n\n\n\"As Ethereum continues to evolve, so too must the security mechanisms designed to protect users from such sophisticated attacks. Awareness and education are the first steps in safeguarding digital assets against emerging threats. Blockchain developers and users alike must remain vigilant, continuously updating their knowledge and security practices to navigate this ever-changing landscape securely.\n\n\n\"This vulnerability highlights the need for enhanced security measures in wallet security products to adapt to the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets in the face of innovative exploits.\"\n\n\nThe big business of crypto attacks\n\n\nTowards the back end of 2023, we saw a string of high-profile wallet-draining attacks netting cybercriminals hefty sums, and the attacks weren't localized to just the Ethereum blockchain either.\n\n\nJustin Sun, founder of the Tron Foundation and owner of Poloniex, a crypto exchange that was \ndrained of circa $120 million\n in November, offered a reward for the attackers at the time to return the funds they stole.\n\n\nThe Monero Project was also \nmysteriously drained\n of nearly half a million dollars just days before, and 5,000 Atomic Wallet users were drained earlier in the year \u2013 just a few of the high-profile incidents that took place in 2023.\n\n\nWhile not all of these have been directly attributed to CREATE2 exploits, researchers told \nThe Register\n that it seems like \nNorth Korea's state-sponsored Lazarus gang\n may have been behind a sizable proportion of them.\n\n\nThe web3 anti-scam solution provider ScamSniffer analyzed a \nseries of CREATE2 incidents\n between May and November 2023, concluding that almost $60 million had been stolen from around 99,000 victims. \u00ae\n\n\n\n"
