        "original_content": "Eralend on [#zkSync] was attacked with a\nloss of $3.4M. The root cause was an inconsistency between the calculated\nborrow value and liquidate value. The amount borrowed was higher than the\namount repaid, allowing the attacker to profit after borrowing and\nliquidation.
