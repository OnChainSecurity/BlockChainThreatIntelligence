The Foundation has seeded the pool with an initial $500,000 and is calling on the community to contribute the remaining $1.5 million by August 1.\nDuring the Attackathon, security researchers will actively search for vulnerabilities in the protocol\u2019s code, following specific rules set for the competition. The event will begin with an educational phase, featuring live technical walkthroughs and content from the Attackathon Academy to prepare participants for identifying potential vulnerabilities.\n\u201cThey will follow specific rules set for the competition, and only impactful and rule-compliant reports will be rewarded. This phase focuses on real-time problem-solving and applying the knowledge gained during the initial phase,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation stated.\nImmunefi, a bug bounty platform known for its experience in web3 security, will host the event. After the competition concludes, Immunefi will evaluate the findings and compile an official report detailing the discovered vulnerabilities and highlighting top researchers.\n\n\nThe EPS team plans to host similar security challenges at every hard fork covering changes to the Ethereum codebase. This initiative comes as Ethereum prepares for its next major upgrade, the \u201c\nPectra\n\u201d hard fork, expected to launch in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\n\n"
