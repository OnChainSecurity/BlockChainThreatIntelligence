        "original_content": "The hacker who plundered more than $230 million worth of crypto assets from the Indian exchange WazirX in July continues to launder their stolen Ethereum (\nETH\n), according to the blockchain security firm PeckShield.\n\n\nPeckShield \nnotes\n an address associated with the hacker transferred 5,000 ETH worth approximately $12 million to a new wallet on Thursday.\n\n\nThat new wallet promptly \nlaundered\n around 1,600 ETH worth $3.86 million to the Ethereum-based coin mixing service Tornado Cash, a controversial platform that helps users conceal their digital assets.\n\n\nSource: PeckShield/X\n\n\nThe hacker has been on the move recently: Earlier this week, a different address associated with the WazirX exploit \nfunneled\n 2600.1 ETH worth approximately $6.5 million to Tornado Cash.\n\n\nIn July, the hacker looted the Indian exchange for $52.5 million worth of Ethereum, $102 million worth of Shiba Inu (\nSHIB\n), $11.24 million worth of Polygon (\nMATIC\n), $7.6 million worth of Pepe (\nPEPE\n), $3.5 million worth of Gala (\nGALA\n) and $5.79 million in Tether (\nUSDT\n), according to the crypto tracker Lookonchain.\n\n\nLast month, WazirX \nannounced\n it was going to roll back all trades and restore all associated account balances to what they were before the withdrawal stoppage on July 18th.\n\n\nCrypto sleuth ZachXBT says the hack appears to be traceable to North Korea\u2019s notorious digital asset hacking organization The Lazarus Group.\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 \nSubscribe\n to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\n\n\n\nCheck \nPrice Action\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on \nX\n, \nFacebook\n and \nTelegram\n\n\n\n\nSurf \nThe Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
