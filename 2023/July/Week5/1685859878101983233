        "original_content": "Hey\n\n[@LefterisJP](/LefterisJP)\n\n, your blame is unfair. There are some facts you did not know. \\- We located\nthis WETH pool (0x8301) issue at 17:10 UTC on July 30. Unfortunately, we\ncannot DM\n\n[@CurveFinance](/CurveFinance)\n\non Twitter because their DM is not allowed. So we shared this finding with a\ntrusted channel and asked him to help forward this finding to the protocol at\n17:16 UTC. After that, we actively monitored this pool for any suspicious\nactivities. \\- Two hours later, at 19:08 UTC, unfortunately, our internal\nsystem reported an attack on this pool. This means attackers have also located\nthe same issue and successfully launched the attack. \\- We need to ensure the\nprotocol and, more importantly, users know this new issue and take action asap\nto save funds. What\u2019s our choice here? Being an ostrich and putting the head\ninto the sand did not help \u2013 attackers have already taken action and will NOT\nstop. We decided to alert the community and the protocol to take action \u2013 the\nTwitter thread you saw (posted at 19:59 UTC). \\- Ten minutes later, we got a\nresponse from the trusted channel and were notified that \"we knew the issue\"\nand tried to rescue but \"weren't fast enough\". We always stand with the users\nand help protect the community. Our records of saving and recusing users'\nfunds have spoken for ourselves. We are sorry if you lose your money in the\nsecurity incident. But your blame on a team trying to help the community is\nunfair."
