After that, three attacks\nhappened between 19:08 and 22:00. Do you think these exploits might have been\nwhite hacked if they hadn't tweeted and confirmed the vulnerable Vyper\nversions? Prejudicially blaming others does not make anyone look any better.\nThe attack timeline comes from\n\n[@tayvano_](/tayvano_)\n\n's Twitter."
