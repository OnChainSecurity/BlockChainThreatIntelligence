Other pools are safe,\u201d Curve wrote.\n\n\nAccording to blockchain auditing firm \nBlockSec\n, current total losses are estimated to be more than $40m worth of crypto. This includes the attack on Curve and a copycat attack on the BNB Smart Chain or BSC. BlockSec posted its estimations on Twitter (\nnow known as X\n).\n\n\nOther projects that use the Vyper programming language could also be at risk and the company has asked all those using the language to reach out to them.\n\n\n\n\nMeir Dolev, co-founder and CTO of cybersecurity firm Cyvers, told \nDecrypt\n that attacks exploiting re-entrancy vulnerabilities are a common vector for hackers to steal from protocols. However, he added that it\u2019s possible to avoid them with \u201cproper design and development.\u201d\n\n\nThe latest attack comes even as cryptocurrency-related crime \nappears to be down significantly\n compared to last year, according to a recent report by Chainalysis.\n\n\nThe blockchain analysis company\u2019s report suggests that illicit activities related to crypto is down by 65pc compared to the same period last year, while deposits made to \u201crisky\u201d entities are down by 42pc.\n\n\nThis follows a particularly crime-riddled year for the sector, as a report in January suggested that the level of\u00a0\ncrypto-based illegal activity in 2022\n\u00a0was the highest on record, with $20.1bn in illegal transactions reported.\n\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI CEO \nSam Altman last week launched Worldcoin\n, an ambitious crypto project to create a global identity and financial network that is \u201cowned by everyone\u201d.\n\n\n10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.
