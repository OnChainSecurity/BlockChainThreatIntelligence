        "original_content": "\n\nSince the data stored in distributed ledgers is authenticated by multiple parties and continually updated, it offers finance teams the possibility of both real-time reporting to management and external auditors, and being able to work more effectively with their external audit and tax providers.\n\n\nImplications for audit\n\n\nBlockchain could have considerable implications for audit as well. Tapscott says: \u201cIf, each time a company entered into a transaction, an unchangeable record was automatically reported to a distributed ledger, \u2026you could actually have a real-time audit, because all transaction data is recorded to the distributed ledger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can see the world moving to real-time auditing,\u201d concurs futurist Rohit Talwar, Editor of\u00a0\nThe Future of Business\n. \u201cAudit firms will provide plug-ins for blockchain, do the audit in real time, spot anomalies and then send in humans to dig deeper if necessary \u2013 unless software can do it for them, of course.\u201d Blockchain could also spell the end of random sampling by auditors, since code could perform a check on every single transaction in future.\n\n\nTalwar also suggests that blockchain, together with artificial intelligence, could transform the way in which fraud investigations and forensic accounting are undertaken. \u201cThe real-time systems would highlight and investigate anomalies and unusual transaction patterns as they emerge,\u201d he explains.\n\n\nNevertheless, many commentators suggest that auditors will always be needed to design the appropriate audit strategies in complex systems \u2013 making decisions about what level of audit is required, how data should be captured, and the type of audit analytics that should be applied. An even more crucial role will be to provide assurance in an increasingly complex control environment and, for instance, to ensure the party or entity that is entering the records on the distributed ledger does actually exist and the transaction has economic substance.\n\n\n\u201cAuditors do far more than just add up the numbers and make sure they come to the right value,\u201d Smart adds. \u201cThey also audit control mechanisms, disaster recovery mechanisms, processes, resilience and systems. So the auditors will also need to audit whether the distributed ledger systems are working correctly.\u201d\n\n\nToo good to be true\n\n\nIn principle, blockchain is extremely secure. That\u2019s because every transaction on blockchain is digitally signed, providing assurance that only a certain party could have recorded it. In addition, the data is validated by a majority of other users on the system. Having said that, if the majority of the users on the distributed ledger become corrupt, it is possible to break the chain. Blockchain can also be vulnerable to programming mistakes, as a Swiss-based DAO \u2013 actually called The DAO \u2013 discovered when it lost US$50m in virtual currency in June 2016 after someone exploited a programming mistake. The reality is that no system is flawless \u2013 not even blockchain.\n\n\n\n"
