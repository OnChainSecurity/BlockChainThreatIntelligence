        "original_content": "The DAO of ETHEREUM:\nAnalyzing the DAO hack, the Blockchain, Smart contracts, and the Law\nThey say it\u2019s lonely at the top, in whatever you do\nYou always gotta watch motherfuckers around you\nNobody\u2019s invincible, no plan is foolproof\nWe all must meet our moment of truth\n \u2014 Gangstar, Moment of Truth\nAs the title suggests, this is my attempt, or practical observation, of the current DAO situation, Ethereum, and what it means to be an to be an entrepreneur in the wider blockchain innovation space.\nIt came to mind, in the current debacle that\u2019s happening, that many lessons can be learned, and that these lessons; no matter how hard they are for Slock.IT, Ethereum, and the wider blockchain ecosystem:\nThat in a strange way, this drama is the best thing that could happen for us all.\nI\u2019m saying this as a Miner, DAO token and Ether holder \u2014 and someone who has a deep appreciation for the Ethereum and DAO teams \u2014 but also with respect for the investors that supported the project.\nMy bias will lean towards the founders and technologists working in this space. Although I will try not to absolve them of any wrongdoing or incompetence, and I will place onus on the investors to understand their own financial risk tolerance, and the technology underlying their investment.\nAs a community, were very much like the characters in the allegorical tale \u201cThe Tao of Pooh\u201d, I won\u2019t get into the book, but if you decide to read it, it\u2019s very short, you will come to see that things are as they should be, and that we all played a part in creating the situation that we have at hand \u2014 that is ongoing, fueled by panic, emotion, and competing self interests.\nI include the \u201c\u201dAttacker\u201d\u201d in this as well, although he\u2019s being villainized, he plays an important, catalyst role, in the future of Ethereum, and blockchain innovation as a whole.\nThis situation is complex, but so is the DAO, Ethereum and what we all want to get out of the respective projects, but in order to un-pack the current crisis we need to understand what happened and the context in which it happened in.\nWhat happened?\nThe short answer is ambition, complexity, and enthusiasm.\nIt\u2019s arguable, but I think few will contest, that the DAO project is one of the most revolutionary and ambitious projects in technology today.\nIt showcased that international crowdfunding works, as it is currently the world\u2019s largest crowdfunded campaign in history.\nIt\u2019s the Napster of finance, international law, and the nature and of work. All wrapped into one organization. The music industry was never the same after Napster.\nFinancial services and international law as we know it, will never be the same after the DAO.\nThe sheer scope of the project demands a technological rigor that only few can attempt, and a scope of knowledge that spans finance, securities, and international law. With many precedents set in a space that is nascent and has no framework for best practices.\nIt\u2019s a new frontier that takes an intrepid nature to even conceive of, let alone attempt.\nWhether you think a fully decentralized and autonomous organization shaped into an investment fund is a good idea or not, the challenge that the Slock.IT team and the collaboration with the people at Ethereum undertook is an endeavor of magnitude and ambition, which was what created the appeal, but at the same time baked in alot of complexity. I\u2019d liken it to Elon musk launching his first space crafts, yes they exploded or did not land, but we all looked at it in amazement because of what he and his team was trying to do, and we supported them along the way.\nComplexity is the enemy of security, and although there was multiple parties who looked at the code, some of the smartest and most accomplished security professionals and visionary technologist, getting the code right from a logical perspective, became problematic to say the least.\nEthereum\nEthereum is a revolutionary, decentralized platform, that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third party interference.\nEssentially developers can make apps that run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.\nThe project was crowdfunded during August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the \nEthereum Foundation\n, a Swiss nonprofit, with contributions from great minds across the globe. [\n1\n]\nThe DAO\nThe DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (\u201cDAO\u201d) \u2014 more specifically, it is a new breed of human organization never before attempted. The DAO was borne from an immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code, operated entirely by its members, and fueled using ETH, the token that represents value on the Ethereum blockchain, which creates DAO tokens.\nThe DAO leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone, anywhere in the world can be empowered to participate. In exchange for their early help, participants receive DAO tokens which represent ownership in the DAO and the right to vote on proposals for the funding of Ethereum blockchain applications\nThe DAO backs proposals, which it selects for their innovative nature, to be delivered by \u201cContractors\u201d. Some of these Proposals could hold no promise of return whatsoever (in the case of a charity for example), others could involve the building of products or services which The DAO could then use for its own purposes.\nThe DAO charges for the use of its the products or services. This revenue is then sent directly to The DAO in the form of ETH. The DAO then has the option to accumulate this ETH to support its growth, or redistribute it to the DAO Token Holders as a reward.\nThe ETH held by The DAO will never be centrally managed as it is fully autonomous and lives on a section of the Ethereum blockchain.\nDAO token holders are able to vote on important decisions relating to the management of The DAO, including the power to redistribute its ETH amongst themselves.[\n2\n]\nThe Attack\nThe same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with\ncould set you up and wet you up, nigga peep the language\nIt\u2019s universal, you play with fire it may hurt you\nor burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through \u2014 \nGangstar, Moment of Truth\nA few days back from the date of this post 3,641,694 ETH was split from \u201ctheDAO\u201d. The \u201cAttacker\u201d found a loophole in the regular \u201csplitDAO\u201d function so that they could reuse the same DAO tokens over and over again.\nEssentially, the \u201c\u201dAttacker\u201d\u201d found a legal \u201cloophole\u201d in the contract code that allowed him/her to exploit the contract unilaterally.\nIn an open letter to the Ethereum community he wrote which is PGP signed and titled: \n\u201cAn Open Letter To the DAO and the Ethereum community\u201d\n the \u201cAttacker\u201d claimed he/she had examined the code and believes the Ether drained is now legitimately his/hers.\nThe \u201cAttacker\u201d writes that people characterizing the event as \u201ctheft\u201d are completely unjustified and that the smart contract itself has allowed this to happen. The \u201cAttacker\u201d writes:\n\u201cI have made use of this feature and have rightfully claimed 3,641,694 ether, and would like to thank the DAO for this reward. It is my understanding that the DAO code contains this feature to promote decentralization and encourage the creation of \u201cchild DAOs\u201d. I am disappointed by those who are characterizing the use of this intentional feature as \u201ctheft\u201d. I am making use of this explicitly coded feature as per the smart contract terms and my law firm has advised me that my action is fully compliant with United States criminal and tort law.\u201d\nThe so-called \u201cAttacker\u201d also cites the written words of the binding smart contract which says,\n\u201cThe terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO\u2019s code.\u201d\nThe author claims that a soft or hard fork would be considered \u201ctheft\u201d in legitimate tort law, and he/she believes the 3.5 million plus Ether was declared legally through the terms of the smart contract.\nThe \u201cAttacker\u201d also says that changing the code in a fork-type manner will destroy the Ethereum community and confidence in the very foundations of smart contracts.\nThe author explains the effect that will take place if developers decide to continue with the fork solutions saying:\n\u201cA soft or hard fork would amount to seizure of my legitimate and rightful ether, claimed legally through the terms of a smart contract. Such fork would permanently and irrevocably ruin all confidence in not only Ethereum but also the in the field of smart contracts and blockchain technology. Many large Ethereum holders will dump their ether, and developers, researchers, and companies will leave Ethereum. Make no mistake: any fork, soft or hard, will further damage Ethereum and destroy its reputation and appeal.\u201d\nThe unconfirmed \u201cAttacker\u201d concludes his/her message by saying legal action has been taken, and he/she is working with a law firm at the moment in regards to this case.\n\u201cAccomplices (developers) taking part in a freeze, hard fork, soft fork, or roll back will \u201cbe receiving Cease and Desist notices in the mail shortly.\u201d\nHe continues by saying:\n\u201cI hope this event becomes a valuable learning experience for the Ethereum community and wish you all the best of luck. Yours truly, \u2018The \u201cAttacker\u201d\u2019\nThe \u201cAttacker\u201d managed to combine 2 exploits. The first exploit was to call the split DAO function\n recursively\n. That means the first regular call would trigger a second (irregular) call of the function and the second call would trigger another call and so on.\nThe following calls are done in a state before the balance of the \u201cAttacker\u201d is set back to 0. This would allow the \u201c\u201dAttacker\u201d\u201d to split multiple times per transaction, probably about 20\u201350 times. He could not do more \u2014 otherwise the transactions would have gotten too big and eventually would have reached the block limite.\nThe \u201cAttacker\u201d managed to replicate this attack from the same two addresses with the same tokens over and over again (roughly 250 times from 2 addresses each). So the \u201cAttacker\u201d found a second exploit that allowed to split without destroying the tokens in the main DAO.\nHe/She managed to transfer the tokens away before they get sent to address 0x0 and only after this they are sent back. The combination of both attacks multiplied the effect. Attack one, on its own, would have been very capital intensive (you need to bring up 1/20 of the stolen amount upfront) \u2014 the attack two would have taken a long time.\nSmart Contracts and the law\nThe details of contract law varies depending on the jurisdiction, but yet the have a broad set of parameters that are uniform based on jurisprudence. Contracts; govern the associations between humans.\nTherefore, although Ethereum and The DAO are both decentralized autonomous organizations and, to a certain extent, they seemingly float above jurisdiction and regulation; because they are on the internet, networked, and/or in the \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 they can under the law, if there was a precedent for this situation, which there is not, be interpreted under \u201cdefault\u201d, (more on this) as a general partnership.\nSecondly, the fascinating features about the DAO is that as it \u201chovers\u201d above specific jurisdictions, it could also be subject to any jurisdiction and none, simply because the contract did not specify any jurisdiction at all, whether real or virtual\nMoreover, even though the The DAO was explicit in its communication that the \u201ccode is the contract\u201d and anything that the codes does is the default, does not mean that other laws don\u2019t apply.\nMany entrepreneurs avoid considering legal context because it\u2019s both confusing and appears to limit choices instead of expanding them. The reality, however, is that making no choice of legal context is a choice \u2014 a choice to abide by the default law. Default laws are often counter-intuitive resulting in harsh unexpected consequences. Failure to choose is the worst choice you can make. [\n4\n]\nDefault laws are laws (or rules) that apply when the parties haven\u2019t made other choices\nCourts will apply these default terms whether or not the parties actually know they exist or understand them. If, however, the terms were clearly specified in the contract, the court would abide by those instead of the default rules.\nWhich is why, in the case of the DAO, a simple but effective remedy that could have mitigated the risks involved, in the event that they did not place the right \u201cclause\u201d in the code; Is a mediation and/or arbitration clause.\nThey are very simple and are offered in a variety of different ways to suit your needs and essentially give you the option to have your case, mediated by professionals in the space, which the courts, must uphold, provided you place this simple clause in your contracts. Here is an example of one.\n\u201cIn the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, the parties shall first seek settlement of that dispute by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.\nIf the dispute is not settled by mediation within [\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026] days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.\nThe language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be [\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026].\nThe governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of [\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026].\nIn any arbitration commenced pursuant to this clause,\n(i) the number of arbitrators shall be [one/three]; and\n(ii) the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be [City and/or Country].\u201d[\n5\n]\nAnother implication that Slock.IT, the \u201cAttacker\u201d and the Ethereum community face, is something known as \u201cequitable remedies\u201d whereby remedies that can be obtained in a \nbreach of contract\n situation and in essence, remedies may be divided into two categories: legal and equitable. Legal remedies allow the non-breaching party; but according to the DAO\u2019s own legal contract, there was nothing in the contract that did not allow the \u201cAttacker\u201d to create a child DAO, and be recursively rewarded in DAO tokens for doing so \u2014 and the intent is completely unimportant \u2014 the only important and relevant governance is the smart contracts themselves. Consequently, there is no real legal difference between a feature and an exploit. It is all a matter of interpretation.\nTo recover monetary damages, in lieu of a breach of contract, equitable remedies are actions that the court prescribes which will serve to resolve the breach or dispute. But in this particular case, because there was no jurisdiction specified, where would a case be pleaded? Or could the case be pleaded in multiple jurisdiction, if a case arose, and one that would be favourable to a plaintiff, or multiple plaintiff given that the DAO would be interpreted as a general partnership?\nEquitable remedies are typically granted when legal remedies or monetary compensation cannot adequately resolve the wrongdoing. It is often a requirement that legal damages be unavailable before a court will decide to issue equitable relief. In the case of Slock.IT the category of equitable remedy that would be most favourable to them would be a \u201cContract Rescission\u201d this is where the old contract which was breached is rescinded or cancelled. A new contract may be written which more clearly addresses the different needs of each party. [\n6\n]\nThe Blockchain and Dual Legal Integration\nA process, that could have been incorporated into the DAO that would have mitigated the risks, or at least would have been able to provide mechanism for remedy if something went wrong is the concept of Dual integration. Which is the the process of integrating a specific legal contract (which can be built with Legal Markdown or any other contract building system) into a specific smart contract which runs on a distributed data store such as Ethereum, or Eris industries [\n7\n]\nThe idea of dual integration is to allow users to be able to have the certainty of having a real world contract which can be taken to a court and enforced using established dispute resolution processes in the jurisdiction(s) of the user(s) while also using a smart contract as the primary mechanism for administering the data-driven interaction which attends to the agreement between the parties.\nFor another system which is also seeking to bridge this gap see \nPrimavera de Filippi\u2019s Draft Legal Framework For Crypto-Ledger Transactions\n.[\n8\n]\nThe reason Eris Industries recommends to all users of Distributed Technology, and particularly smart contracts, to dual-integrate their smart contracts with real world legal contracts built by lawyers qualified in the jurisdiction(s) that will be relevant to the agreement, is simple.\nSmart contracts are necessarily limited. And the fallout of the DAO is a direct showcase of how dumb smart contracts can be.\nAs they are, at their core, just scripts which live in a distributed data store, the pure code of a smart contract has a limited ability to \u201creach\u201d outside the context of their data store to incorporate a legally-binding contractual understanding. While they are capable of being structured in a manner which would automatically administer a data-driven interaction and ensure harmony of the data set in which the smart contracts reside (if they have permissions to do so),judges are unlikely, for the foreseeable future, to be able to easily resolve disputes stemming from smart contracts solely on the basis of their coded parameters (meaning without an integrated legal contract) without simply applying the commercial defaults for the agreement in the jurisdiction \u2014 an end that is unlikely to reflect the intention of the parties to the agreement in question. For these reasons of the limited reach of smart contracts and the limited enforceability of smart contracts, we highly encourage all smart contract systems developers to utilize dual integration of some kind.\nNobody knows right now if there will be lawsuits from the $50m-plus attack the DAO, but the notion of decentralised governance is a model that will be tested, scrutinized, and debated for a long time to come.\nI likened The DAO to Napster, in the sense that it created a shockwave of disruption that forever changed the landscape of music, by calling into question ownership in a peer to peer network, to exchange the title and ownership of music; and here is an example where the DAO has caused the same uproar in the financial and legal community regarding associations and legal formations in the world of cryptography.\nIn time, it may be that regulators and courts, or maybe even a \nDecentralized Arbitration and Mediation Network\n decide these things. I do not know quite how a court would decide this situation as I am not a lawyer, and nothing that I have written here should be construed as legal advice, but it is quite possible that in the eyes of the court, the hacker is himself is simply a legitimate operator operating in the bounds of the smart contract and it is those who are attempting to change the smart contract through soft or hard fork are in effect, violating the law.\nWhat can be done?\nIdeally, the DAO developers will find a way to extract the stolen funds without any protocol alterations (aka \u201chard fork\u201d). However, such a plan, if feasible, will take time to design, test and deploy. If Slock.IT and the Ethereum team can find a way of remedying the situation through their own \u201cattack\u201d (DAO war), then investors will still have thier funds, the DAO can go on, in whatever capcity they feel is relevant and suitable, and the integrity of Ethereum will remain intact in the eyes of the community.\nIf not feasible, an alternative approach will have to be found, quite possibly a minor hard-fork of the core protocol. Either way there has to be a limit to the damage being done \u2014 the fastest, most effective way of doing this is through a temporary soft-fork.\nBut what if they can\u2019t?\nSince the DAO has no internal governance mechanism to reverse the alterations that have already happened, any kind of intervention to recover the stolen funds would take the form of a hard-fork: an alteration of the core Ethereum protocol.\nWhat is a soft Fork?\nA soft-fork is a minor, temporary alteration to the protocol all remnants of which can eventually be removed from the protocol with no recourse for syncing the blocks that were introduced during the period that it was in effect. Basically, it requires only the acquiescence of implementers and miners and need have no long-term repercussions, neither in terms of the code-bases nor in terms of the protocol spec.\n\u201cParity\u201d the lighter and faster, and more secure ethereum client, that is written with a different programming language called \u201cRust\u201d, already has such a soft-fork waiting, which would lock the stolen funds, preventing them from being removed, exchanged or sold.\n[9\n]\nWhat is a Hard Fork?\nA hard fork would require longer discussion and consensus finding in the Ethereum community, but essentially it would remove all funds from the \u201cAttackers\u201d child DAO and move them to a to a new smart contract and would replace the contract at the main DAO with a simple refund contract with only one function. This function takes one parameter (address of childDAO), to determine a combined balance of mainDAO and childDAO and then pays back ether accordingly (in order to also pay back DAO token holders who did already split)\nWith this solution, 100% of the funds can be refunded, with no rollback of blocks or transactions is required.\nUsually when people think about hard forks, they imagine about rollbacks of entire blocks, undoing unrelated transactions (similar to bitcoin hard forks). But in this case,the hard fork is far more elegant and easier to implement, as there is no need to roll any blocks back, or to undo any transactions that have nothing to do with the DAO.\nIn fact, a typical ethereum user will not feel anything from that hardfork, besides a minor client update. [\n10\n]\nThe Cost of Innovation and the perils of progress\n\u201cThe play-it-safe pessimists of the world never accomplish much of anything, because they don\u2019t look clearly and objectively at situations, they don\u2019t recognize or believe in their own abilities to overcome even the smallest amount of risk.\u201d\n \u2014 Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh\nThe DAO experiment is one of the most exciting projects in the world today, challenging the notions of international finance and governance, and testing the limits of blockchain technology. It is the very definition of entrepreneurship and an expose on innovation at it\u2019s highest ideals.\nIn saying this, it is not to excuse the responsibility that comes with dealing with this powerful technology or the regulations that we have in place for financial dealings and organizations, but a testament to the spirit of entrepreneurship that progresses our society.\nThe notion that a small team of curious, and talented individuals can launch, from their grandmother\u2019s house in europe, and align the focus and sentiment, of like minded individuals from around the world, to create an unmanned investment vehicle to benefit the ambitions of a community \u2014 all working on projects that might not otherwise get funded; is a showcase of courage in a world where a lot of people have ideas, and blow hard on the hype of blockchain technology, yet have nothing to show for it.\nWe have banks banding together to pay exorbitant amounts of money to hold hands as they jump into the shallow end of blockchain technology, while these entrepreneurs with limited resources at hand, systematically changed how we view organizations, the law and finance.\nAre there problems, yes. Are there going to be mistakes. Of course. But If you know the story of Slock.IT and Etherem, both partners of a similar vision, you know that 10 months ago Ethereum was launched and it was one of the worlds largest crowdfunded projects in history raising 18m EU, for one of the world\u2019s most revolutionary advancements in cryptography and computer science. Then 10 months later, that same group of friends banded together to out do themselves, obviously by accident, to raise another DAO worth up to 250 million USD in less than a month from launch.\nAs an \u201cinvestor\u201d in many of these projects, Ethereum and the DAO, I\u2019m well aware of the risks. Anyone who dropped money into this venture, small or large, expecting a 6000% return on investment in 6 months, was deluding themselves, or was not truly assessing the risk involved in an experimental technology and investment vehicle.\nThankfully, given the sentiment that I have come across online, many did not have that intention, but to help other startups in the space progress with a technology that many do not really understand. It\u2019s very hard to pitch these types of projects to investors unless they are knowledgeable about the space and technology, which apart from the illusory hype, is very very few people.\nThe DAO and Ethereum are creating ways for entrepreneurs to have the resources and the scale to realize their ideas and for this reason alone, aside from the mishap that caused the splitting of 50m USD from the DAO, this project has had far more positive intentions than negative fallout.\nThis technology is experimental, it\u2019s not even a year old and it\u2019s already provided evidence, for better or for worse, of what it can do, and we haven\u2019t even nicked the surface of the types of applications and products that it can enable.\nEthereum, and the blockchain ecosystem is still nascent, still growing, and in its early stage of development. It\u2019s expected that things will go wrong, it\u2019s understood that this is the exploratory phase of growth, but without people pushing the limits of imagination and capabilities we will be stuck with the problems of old without any solutions that can remedy the impediments of our society.\nThe Future\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t the knowledge that comes from experience more valuable than the knowledge that doesn\u2019t? \n\u2014 Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh\nThis situation has turned out to be the \u201cToo big to fail\u201d scenario that we blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts have railed against in the \u201creal world\u201d and have pinned hopes on platforms like Ethereum and the DAO. Although this is a challenging time for the Slock.IT team and the Ethereum community, I firmly believe that the distributed vision of the future is being lead by thoughtful and considerate leaders in the community like Ethereum and Slock.IT, and that the first widely adopted Decentralized Autonomous Organization will be an amazing learning lesson and catalyst for more bold and visionary projects in the future."
