        "original_content": "\n\n\n\nOur increasingly connected and digital lives are making us more vulnerable to cyberattacks than ever. As was the case in \nprevious years\n, 2016 saw a spate of cyberattacks of unprecedented proportions. Some of these incidents were a reminder that \nthe internet is no longer fun and games\n. \n\n\nWhat we also learned was that the current infrastructure that powers our current local and global networks might no longer be able to \nsustain the new generation of attacks and threats\n.\n\n\nEnter the \nblockchain\n, the distributed ledger that underlies the popular and controversial Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the technology that is the result of decades of research in cybersecurity and cryptography.\n\n\nBlockchain\u2019s decentralized structure and robust security offers a totally different approach to storing information and transactions, which can prove to be more \nresilient and sometimes immune to cyberattacks\n.\n\n\nHere are some of the threats that might become a thing of the past with blockchain.\n\n\nMan in the middle attacks\n\n\nCurrent encrypted communications such as HTTPS and TLS rely on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Certificate Authorities (CA) to secure channels. Every participant has an asymmetric private/public encryption key pair (see \nthis post\n for a brief explanation of how asymmetric encryption works), keeping the private key to themselves while making the public key available to the public through trusted a trusted broker (the CA).\n\n\nWhen a user wants to establish a secure connection (such as sending an encrypted email or connecting to a website), they pull off their interlocutor\u2019s public key from the broker\u2019s repository and encrypt their data before sending it, knowing that it can only be decrypted at the destination where the private key exists.\n\n\nTherefore, the integrity of the system will depend on how secure the central broker and holder of public keys is. If the CA goes down, communications fail. \n\n\nIf it becomes compromised, something worse will happen. Attackers will then be able to stage man-in-the-middle attacks by providing users with forged public keys, to which they hold the private keys, and they can thus decrypt sensitive information. (It\u2019s actually \na bit more complicated\n, but this is as simple as I can make it in a short paragraph.) \n\n\nIn contrast, a blockchain approach can make MitM attacks virtually impossible. When users publish their public keys on the blockchain, the information will be distributed across thousands and millions of nodes, and linked to previous blocks stored on the ledger.\n\n\nIt will be impossible for hackers to circumvent the cryptography that makes the blockchain immutable, and there will be no single node they can compromise to publish their fake keys.\n\n\nData tampering\n\n\nLast February, hackers managed to \ncompromise the website of Linux Mint\n and distribute their own infected version of the operating system, which contained a backdoor. Distributors usually publish hashes of their software binaries to provide users with a means to verify the authenticity of their copy.\n\n\nHowever, the problem is, when hackers compromise the website, they\u2019ll publish the hash of their own version of the operating system, duping unfortunate users into thinking they\u2019ve downloaded the authentic version of the software.\n\n\nThe same can be applied to any other data that is made available to the public or distributed to a specific network. There\u2019s no definite way to make sure the data hasn\u2019t been tampered with if the hash can be compromised and changed.\n\n\nIn contrast, imagine a blockchain where every user can publish a hash associated to a particular file, OS image, software binary, or any other data which needs to be protected from tampering. While an attacker might be able to compromise the storage location and tamper with the data, they won\u2019t be able to change the hash stored on the blockchain. This will make it known to everyone that the data has been manipulated.\n\n\nThe difference between the blockchain security and traditional models is that, instead of relying on preserving secrets, the blockchain relies on transparency and general knowledge to protect information and data.\n\n\nDDoS attacks\n\n\nThe \nmassive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack of last October\n, which cut off millions of users from major services such as Twitter, PayPal, Netflix and Spotify, reminded us of the \ninsecurity of the internet of things\n and the vulnerability of the infrastructure that underlies the internet.\n\n\nWhat made the attack notable was that instead of attacking each of the websites, the attackers targeted the servers of Dyn, the company providing DNS services to millions of users. By bringing down Dyn\u2019s server, all of the sites whose domains were being resolved through Dyn became inaccessible.\n\n\nThe Dyn attack was another example of how single points of failure and centralized systems are making us vulnerable. An even more evil scenario would be to compromise a DNS server and change entries to redirect users to malicious versions of websites.\n\n\nA workaround would be to have a DNS system based on blockchain. Instead of relying on central DNS servers to store name-IP resolution pairs, every entry is registered on the blockchain and distributed among the nodes that constitute the blockchain. \n\n\nThis provides both transparency and security. Hackers will no longer be able to target the DNS infrastructure by attacking a specific server or server cluster, and the data entries can\u2019t be tampered to direct traffic to malicious sources.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nThe vulnerabilities of centralized systems are becoming more and more evident as cyberattacks grow in size and number. Decentralized alternatives can offer a workaround to those vulnerabilities, but they need to run on a platform that doesn\u2019t introduce its own security holes. Blockchain might prove to be the technology to power secure, reliable and decentralized services. There are already many exciting projects being led in each of these fields. It will be interesting how the trend develops into a replacement for the infrastructure and models that we\u2019ve been using for decades.\n\n\nLike this:\nLike\n \nLoading...\n \n\n"
