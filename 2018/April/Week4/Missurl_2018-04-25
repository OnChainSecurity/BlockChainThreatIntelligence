The redirects occurred for about two hours.\nAnyone who logged into their account would have had their credentials compromised.

The incident also highlighted well-known weaknesses in core internet infrastructure.\n\n\"Mounting an attack of this scale requires access to BGP routers at major ISPs and real computing resource to deal with so much DNS traffic. It seems unlikely MyEtherWallet.com was the only target, when they had such levels of access,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The security vulnerabilities in BGP and DNS are well known, and have been attacked before. This is the largest scale attack I have seen which combines both, and it underscores the fragility of internet security. It also highlights how almost nobody noticed until the attack stopped. There is a blind spot.\"\n\nPrevious and related coverage\nAWS announces Secrets Manager, more tools for security\"Security is all of our jobs,\" Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said Wednesday.\n\nAmazon adds security monitoring and threat defence with GuardDuty\n\nPowered by machine learning, Amazon GuardDuty analyses public and AWS-generated events to notify users of anomalies and offer remediation advice.\n\nAWS acquires threat detection firm Sqrrl\n\nSqrrl's team has past connections to US intelligence agencies.\n\nEditorial standards\nShow Comments\n"
