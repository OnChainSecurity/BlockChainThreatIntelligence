A 2018 study by the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office found that 27% of all seafood sold in the state was tagged under the wrong product name. Food categories that command premium pricing, such as Kobe beef, extra-virgin olive oil, and organic foods, are frequent targets of fraudulent labeling. Medicines are also highly vulnerable to fraud. The World Health Organization estimates that trade in counterfeit medicines is worth about \u20ac73 billion annually. Improper substitutions and defective parts create enormous risks for companies and buyers alike. In addition to the health and safety issues posed, breakdowns in provenance and procurement can result in lawsuits, customer disaffection, and costly and disruptive product recalls. The expansion of global supply chains has created an even wider ripple effect. Stakeholders across the supply chain need assurance that goods have been stored and maintained in the right conditions. In 2016, a recall of sunflower seeds due to possible listeria contamination affected hundreds of products across dozens of brands.\n Blockchain solutions have the potential to bring much-needed relief in each of these areas, protecting customers and businesses from the risks associated with counterfeit products, mislabeling, and substandard storage and manufacturing. Smart digital tags can establish provenance, and \u00adtrack-and-trace capabilities can scour \u00adtransaction histories to validate sourcing end to end. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors connected to blockchain platforms can \u00adautomatically transmit and record temperature, humidity, and other data, assuring stakeholders that items have been properly housed and transported.\n However, knowing where blockchain can help is just the first step in assessing value. To understand the total value relative to other opportunities, investors need to consider specific use case applications and assess the potential for additional downstream benefits and adjacencies.\nNot all Use Cases Are Created Equal\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the value of a blockchain-\u00adenabled provenance solution for a particular item correlates with its ease of authentication, the importance of its sourcing journey, and its pricing power.\n The ability to attach a unique identifier to a single unit of a good allows blockchain applications to record an item\u2019s provenance and trace its journey along the supply chain. The easier it is to attach these unique identifiers to, say, a shoe, an electronics component, or an automotive part, the quicker the path to value. A diamond, for example, has unique, easily ascertained visual characteristics that allow it to be individually tagged, whereas a vegetable\u2019s unique characteristics might require DNA analysis. More involved solutions, such as those that combine blockchain with IoT to authenticate cashless transactions or establish voter eligibility, may take slightly longer to test, build, and scale. Yet, these systems could generate significant long-term value once established.\n In addition, traceability must confer a material benefit: Is it a \u201cnice to have,\u201d as in the case of a certified-organic label, or is it a \u201cmust have?\u201d In general, the greater the need for traceability, the greater the value.\n Finally, the product or brands involved should command strong pricing power to justify the cost of building a blockchain network and the large adopter base needed to make the platform usable. The higher the premiums involved\u2014a designer sneaker, for instance, versus a mass-market brand\u2014the more value there is in confirming a good\u2019s legitimacy. Concentrating on select, high-value areas can allow the cost of developing the blockchain network and operating the algorithms to be spread across the user base. In situations that involve component parts or nonpremium brands, manufacturers may need to look at more creative ways to employ blockchain, such as using IoT tags that can add a unique identifier to products.\nInvestors Must Look Beyond Short-Term Benefits\n\n\nCompanies and investors should not limit their valuation analyses to the immediate investment thesis. Adjacent applications and new markets created within three to five years could deliver significant benefits, the value of which could eclipse that of the initial business case. Each potential solution needs to be evaluated on a holistic basis, considering first-, second-, and third-order benefits, in order to select the most promising opportunities.\n \nFirst-Order Benefits.\n To assess the immediate value potential, investors should focus on what the blockchain application is specifically designed to do and the direct problem it is looking to solve. Homing in on those questions can help investors evaluate how effective the solution is likely to be and how large a market it can attract.\nSecond-Order Benefits.\n Next, investors\u00a0should consider what additional sources\u00a0of value the blockchain \u00adsolution\u00a0could deliver. The UN World Food Programme, for instance, is developing a blockchain platform to make it easier for refugees to access and\u00a0use food vouchers. In time, the same blockchain engine could be used to support financial transactions, giving refugees who lack access to formal banking systems a way to access cash and build savings.\nThird-Order Benefits.\n Finally, as blockchain platforms and their underlying protocols evolve, new features and solutions can be added. Some of these may exist, but others may spring from as-yet unknown innovations that could be built on top of existing infrastructure. Investors need to consider whether the solutions being evaluated could serve as an anchor for marketplaces yet to be conceived.\nThe blockchain platform Tracr illustrates how these benefits could play out. Developed by De Beers, Tracr is intended to bring greater transparency to provenance and sourcing in the diamond industry. The first-order benefits are the premium that people might be willing to pay for a diamond that is guaranteed to be both legitimate and ethically sourced. These benefits are likely to be considerable in their own right. But the platform could also deliver significant second-order benefits. Right now, for instance, the lack of a reliable way to identify and authenticate diamonds at scale could allow fraudulent actors to use the same stone as collateral for multiple loans. A platform like Tracr that records each diamond by its unique identifier could allow banks and lenders to identify such \u201cdouble spending.\u201d Potential third-\u00adorder benefits could include the platform\u2019s ability to connect all diamond industry suppliers on a single, standardized platform. Doing so would allow rapid, seamless communication between parties, enabling the easy transfer of money between countries and the trading of assets without \u00admiddlemen. Taken together, these first-, \u00adsecond-, and third-order benefits could \u00addramatically change the long-term ROI \u00adpotential of the blockchain investment, \u00adinformation that could help private equity players place smarter bets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select the most promising opportunities, companies need to consider the first-, second-, and third-order benefits of each blockchain solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Barriers to \u00adBlockchain\u2019s Success\n\n\nWhile blockchain\u2019s use in combating \u00adcounterfeiting has extraordinary potential, certain factors can slow momentum if poorly managed.\n The first is the question of proof. Blockchain may serve as a single source of truth, but that implies that relevant stakeholders agree on what constitutes proof. Is it a purchase order, a letter of credit, or a certificate of authenticity from an approved body? A government contractor might accept a supplier\u2019s invoice as proof that parts were manufactured in an approved jurisdiction, but government auditors may require more detailed documentation that lists where the underlying components were purchased. For blockchain to work effectively, all parties must share a common definition of the truth.\n Regulatory concerns can be another issue. Use cases related to heavily regulated sectors such as financial services and health care could be subject to more stringent \u00adrequirements. While the impact is likely to be minimal in most applications, regulators may want participants in blockchain \u00adapplications that involve money transfers or the use of a diamond or other asset as collateral for a loan to abide by banking compliance provisions. Similarly, in health care settings, regulators will want to know that core consumer protections around data privacy and medical records will also be upheld.\n Finally, investors need to be satisfied that the company leading the blockchain \u00adeffort\u00a0has the necessary resources and clout to bring key players together. Building a \u00adsuccessful platform requires industry peers to set aside their competitive \u00addif\u00adferences and work together. Managing that \u00ad\u201ccoopetition\u201d paradox takes strong \u00adleadership skills. \u00adInvestors need to know that the company or its key partner have sufficient authority to drive the effort and that the right \u00adincentives are in place to \u00adattract other \u00adimportant stakeholders. For instance, Walmart failed with its first \u00adattempt at a supply chain \u00adplatform because it sought to manage it as a proprietary \u00adsystem. Suppliers balked \u00adbecause joining the platform would have required man\u00adaging a second set of books. Recognizing the issue, Walmart repositioned the \u00adplatform as a single, industrywide model, giving \u00adsup\u00adpliers and customers greater \u00adincentive to join. Managing stakeholder \u00adcollaboration \u00adeffectively is a critical \u00adsuccess\u00a0factor.\n \n Blockchain technology has the potential to prevent fraudulent actors from profiting off counterfeit parts and goods, addressing a longstanding issue that cuts across industries, exposes consumers to health and safety risks, and results in billions of dollars in lost sales. However, blockchain-enabled counterfeit prevention tools are still in their nascency and value can vary widely. To make informed decisions, companies and investors need to assess first-, second-, and third-order benefits on a use case basis and ensure that initiatives have the ability to gain critical mass and satisfy regulatory and other criteria. By focusing on opportunities where blockchain can relieve persistent pain points and on use cases where sourcing is key to value and pricing is strong, investors can help lower their risk and accelerate the path to value.\n \n\n"
