But the amazing expediency of the digital age comes with a cost. Namely, \nour privacy\n.\n\n\nOur dozens of accounts spread throughout the web and protected only by often \nweak passwords\n include bank accounts, health records, birthdays, social security numbers and passport information.\n\n\nBlockchain Cybersecurity Uses\nMaintaining cryptocurrency integrity\nSecuring banking assets\nProtecting patient health records\nRevamping government cybersecurity protocols\nSafeguarding military and defense data\nFortifying Internet of Things (IoT) devices\n\n\n\n\nThe information age explosion of online data has brought with it lapses in security protocols that regularly expose our most sensitive information to malicious actors. Finding a reliable\u00a0\ncybersecurity\n protocol, therefore, is more important than ever before.\u00a0\n\n\nIndustries across the board are latching onto new technology that promises to improve online safety, with \nblockchain\n cybersecurity leading the way.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain: A New Weapon in Cybersecurity\u00a0\n\n\nCybercrime\n is such a vast and burgeoning underworld industry that it prompted Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President and CEO of IBM, to declare that \u201c\ncybercrime, by definition, is the greatest threat to every profession, every industry, every company in the world.\n\u201d\n\n\nBoth dangerous and costly, cybercrime costs the global economy an estimated \n$445 billion per year\n. Our current security protocols simply cannot keep up with the relentless and clever attacks.\n\n\nBlockchain, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), is focused on creating trust in an untrusting ecosystem, making it a potentially strong \ncybersecurity technology\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe ledger system is decentralized, but information is transparently available to members of the specific blockchain. All members (or nodes) can record, pass along and view any transactional data that is encrypted onto their blockchain.\n\n\nThis process creates trust while also maintaining a high level of data integrity. In essence, the distributed nature of blockchain\u00a0\nprovides no \u201chackable\u201d entrance\n or point of failure that detrimentally exposes entire datasets.\n\n\nThe cybersecurity industry can benefit from blockchain\u2019s unique features, which create a virtually impenetrable wall between a hacker and your information.\n\n\nThe transparent ledger allows for password-free entry. Using biometrics, including retina scans and fingerprints, the ledger can create a single-source, uncrackable form of entry into any private data.\n\n\nDecentralized storage ensures that each block contains only a small informational piece to a much larger puzzle, limiting hackable data to almost nothing.\n\n\nFinally, blockchain\u2019s public record-keeping system gives each node an insight into any data manipulation, exposing potential \ncybercrime attempts\n in real time.\n\n\nBlockchain in cybersecurity is widespread, and we\u2019ve rounded up six industries that use it as a new weapon in the fight to protect our most sensitive information.\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain in Cybersecurity Examples | Video: Blockgeeks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain and Cryptocurrency Integrity\n\n\nFirst implemented as the operational network behind Bitcoin, blockchain is now used in more than \n1,000 different cryptocurrencies\n, a number that grows almost daily.\n\n\nDLT protects the integrity of cryptos through \nencryption methods\n and public information sharing.\n\n\nThe legitimacy of cryptocurrency purchases by individuals is ensured because they can trace the transfer of the currency to its origin. Encryption helps\u00a0\ncontrol the number of cryptocurrencies being created\n, thus stabilizing value.\n\n\nThese companies use blockchain as a cybersecurity protocol in cryptocurrency trading.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation: \nSan Francisco, California\n\n\n\nMany users know \nCash App\n as a peer-to-peer payment platform, but the company has also moved into becoming a marketplace for buying and selling bitcoin. Cash App holds users\u2019 bitcoin in their high-security storage, which is protected by its encryption technology. Despite the heightened security Cash App offers, when users want to access their bitcoin, they can withdraw it whenever they need it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Fully Remote\n\n\nCoinbase\n is an exchange for users to buy and sell digital currency. Users can trade everything from Bitcoin to Litecoin to Ethereum on the company\u2019s secure blockchain platform. Coinbase runs entirely on encryption. The company stores \nwallets\n and passwords in a secure database and requires employees to undergo a rigorous background check, all to ensure that their crypto is safe.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation:\n San Francisco, California\n\n\nMobileCoin\n develops an easy-to-use cryptocurrency for resource-constrained businesses that aren\u2019t currently equipped to securely handle ledger information. The company\u2019s crypto replaces third-party transaction vendors, and it keeps all transactional data between two peers encrypted. The boosted level of security helps companies keep transparent records in the public sphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\nJavvy\n built a universal \u201cwallet\u201d that stores and trades cryptocurrencies and tokens. The company\u2019s blockchain-based app is fully decentralized, biometric-login-enabled and uses AI to detect fraudulent activity. Javvy\u2019s app helps users manage their growing crypto stashes in a more secure way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Washington, D.C.\n\n\nFounders Bank\n aims to be the world\u2019s first decentralized bank. Instead of being owned by a central authority, the bank is owned by purchasers of its token-based equity.\u00a0 The company employs decentralized storage methods, an extensive public ledger system and encryption methods to make sure cryptocurrencies are traded and stored securely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBanking and Blockchain\n\n\nWall Street has begun to take notice of blockchain\u2019s bolstered security protocols. Traditionally known as slow movers in adopting new technologies, some of Wall Street\u2019s largest \nfinancial institutions\n (including JP Morgan and Bank of America) are trying to stay ahead of the curve. JP Morgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank has been\u00a0\nlooking at blockchain for solutions to cybersecurity issues.\n\n\nTrillions of dollars in cash flow combined with outdated and centralized cybersecurity protocols make the largest banks constant targets of hacking and fraud. In fact, most multinational banks currently experience cyber attacks daily, with cyber criminals focused on operational risks. In its annual report, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said\u00a0\nmore sophisticated phishing attacks\n target employees who have access to credentialed information. The report suggests a multi-layered security protocol to decentralize risk \u2014 exactly what blockchain can provide. Here are three early adopters among \u201ctraditional\u201d Wall Street\u00a0\nbanks that use blockchain technology\n to guard their most important data. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Boston, Massachusetts\n\n\nSantander\n was the first bank in the UK to adopt blockchain to securitize their international payments service. The bank\u2019s blockchain enables customers to securely pay between Santander accounts in Europe and South America. In partnership with Ripple, Santander\u2019s \u201cOne Pay FX\u201d is now live in Spain, the UK, Poland and Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n London, England\n\n\nBarclays\n filed a patent that would use \nblockchain technology\n to bolster security in fund transfers. The Wall Street bank is possibly looking to boost the popularity and stability of cryptocurrency transfers while using DLT to process these transfers. Along with its blockchain fund transfer patent, Barclays has a patent for know-your-customer processes that enables the bank to store all personal identifying customer information on a secure blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\nBlockchain in Finance: What It Is and How It's Used\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPatient Health Records and Blockchain\n\n\nLike banking, the healthcare industry endures a constant barrage of cyber attacks. In fact, healthcare experiences\u00a0\ntwice the amount of phishing emails and malware attacks\n of any other industry. New challenges arise constantly and now include cyber-attacks on IoT devices that are disguised using encrypted malware.\n\n\nNot only do \nhealthcare companies\n, hospitals, doctors and clinics store patient banking information, they also possess important health records. Patient data is important to cyber criminals because it demands much more money on the black market \u2014 \nup to $250 per record\n. Credit card information is constantly stolen, but modern technology typically resolves any damage quickly. Exposing the social security numbers, full names, weights, heights, prescriptions and medical conditions of millions of patients can be detrimental. By threatening to release confidential information, hackers have already \nextorted millions\n of dollars from hospitals all over the world and will continue to do so unless new technologies are implemented.\n\n\nBlockchain could be the badly-needed solution to a problem that puts patients and hospitals at severe risk. The DLT\u2019s decentralized state allows only certain individuals to have small amounts of information that, if combined, would comprise a patient\u2019s entire health chart. The distribution of only certain information to credentialed healthcare professionals ensures that cybercriminals cannot access all identifiable aspects of an individual\u2019s health record.\n\n\nRead about four healthcare companies that use blockchain cybersecurity measures to thwart attacks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\n\nPhilips Healthcare\n, part of the\u00a0\nPhilips Research\n firm, is pairing blockchain with AI to create a new healthcare ecosystem. In partnership with hospitals all over the world, the company uses AI to discover and analyze all aspects of the healthcare system, including operational, administrative and medical data. It then implements blockchain to secure the massive amounts of data collected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Nashville, Tennessee\n\n\nHashed Health\n is a healthcare innovation firm dedicated to helping the industry implement blockchain technologies. Consisting of Hashed Collective, Hashed Enterprise and Hashed Labs, which focus on different aspects of blockchain, Hashed Health\u2019s ecosystem includes a blockchain healthcare community. Hashed Health has worked with dozens of healthcare companies and hospitals to build secure digital blockchain networks for patient information sharing and internal communication channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Mountain View, California\n\n\nHealth Linkages\n uses blockchain to enable transparent data governance, further auditable analytics and boost compliance in the healthcare sector. The company\u2019s blockchain enables only credentialed actors to share patient data, and it also maintains a chronological series of individual healthcare events, making healthcare decisions clearer for doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation:\n London, England\n\n\nMedicalchain\n makes it easier for patients and healthcare professionals to access patient data with its blockchain platform. The company creates a centralized location for storing complete electronic health records, so patients and health groups know where to find accurate info. Patient data also isn\u2019t stored directly on the blockchain, so approved personnel can find specific data without worrying about hackers compromising transfers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\nAI Blockchain: 30 Examples to Know\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain and Military and Defense Data\n\n\nInnovation within the military and defense sectors has led to some of the biggest technological breakthroughs in the past century. The\u00a0\nU.S. military pioneered the Internet\n to share important detailed information with dispersed groups all over the world, and it created GPS to better grasp military positioning. Will blockchain be the next breakthrough technology that\u2019s promoted by the defense sector?\n\n\nAccording to Accenture, \n61 percent of aerospace and defense companies\n have adopted blockchain solutions. Blockchain is seen as a legitimate data safeguard for militaries, defense contractors and \naerospace\n companies that house some of the most sensitive information.\n\n\nThese militaries and defense companies use blockchain\u2019s encryption and decentralization methods to improve data security and maximize privacy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation:\n Bethesda, Maryland\n\n\nLockheed Martin\n is the first U.S. defense contractor to implement blockchain into its protocol. The company teamed up with\u00a0\nGuardtime Federal\n to implement \nblockchain cybersecurity\n protocol measures in the engineering systems, supply chain risk management and software development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation: \nArlington, Virginia\n\n\nThe \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\n is the technology development branch of the U.S. Army and is looking into blockchain mainly for its usefulness in encryption and secure data transfer. Engineers created an encrypted, blockchain-based messaging system for U.S. military personnel to instantaneously share vital information to any location on the globe without worrying about foreign hackers listening in.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation:\n Fully Remote\n\n\nTrail of Bits\n\u2019 cybersecurity consulting services cover a variety of areas, including blockchain. Its team members leverage their expertise in smart contracts, decentralized finance and other aspects of blockchain technology to identify vulnerabilities and develop tools and strategies for fortifying blockchain applications. For example, \nTrail of Bits produced a publicly available research report for DARPA\n on blockchain\u2019s decentralized nature and the potential risk of exploitation, providing a \u201c30-thousand-foot view of what\u2019s currently known about blockchain technology.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) Security and Blockchain\n\n\nThe \nInternet of Things\n (IoT) is a growing industry full of innovation, creativity and, consequently, cybersecurity issues. Nowadays, IoT products can be found in almost every aspect of our lives. From robo-sprinklers to Bluetooth-enabled bike locks to smart kitchen appliances, everything is wirelessly connected.\n\n\nThere have been thousands of reported IoT device hacks over the last few years, a number that will surely increase in light of estimates that there will be \nover 55 billion connected IoT devices\n by 2025.\u00a0One cybersecurity-related report found that hackers were able to bypass the security measures in an implantable cardiac device, which gave them the ability to deplete the battery as well as administer incorrect heart shocks. Additionally, it was reported that\u00a0\nhackers targeted the camera of a \u201csmart\u201d baby monitor\n by obtaining a simple IP address. The hackers had full control of the machine to watch through the camera and listen in on conversations.\n\n\nAs the IoT device market continues to grow, so too does the need for an enhanced form of cybersecurity. Blockchain provides a safe infrastructure for the transfer of data from one device to another without the interference of malicious actors. Decentralized control enables IoT devices to create audit trails and tracking methods for registering and using products.\n\n\nThese four companies are focusing on diminishing hacking opportunities and maximizing cybersecurity strength within the Internet of Things.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n San Jose, California\n\n\nAs part of the Trusted IoT Alliance, networking giant \nCisco\n belongs to a group that is considering scaling technologies to enhance the security of IoT products. The company believes blockchain pairs well with IoT devices because the ledger technology eliminates single points of failure and secures data through encryption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n Zug, Switzerland\n\n\nHdac\n\u2019s blockchain platform for IoT devices supports everything from payments between devices to the safe transfer of data. The company claims its hardware wallets are immune to viruses because its blockchain platform runs on a hidden network. Already successful with smart wallets, Hdac pivoted to introducing blockchain IoT cybersecurity protocols to all connected devices in smart factories, smart homes and smart buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation:\n Palo Alto, California\n\n\nCatering to IoT environments, \nXage Security\n has built a blockchain-powered platform that comes with advanced security measures. The company follows a zero-trust remote access policy, meaning that team members can only execute authorized interactions. Hackers can no longer take advantage of broad or poorly defined permissions, allowing businesses to protect data that is transferred between devices.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLocation:\n Austin, Texas\n\n\nGrid+\n delivers a more seamless experience for crypto users by guarding assets with its Lattice1 device and encrypted SafeCard. The Lattice1 provides a secure interface that can connect to various crypto wallets, networks and any MetaMask blockchain. Customers can then store their crypto assets on a SafeCard for additional protection and insert the card into their Lattice1 device when they\u2019re ready to access their assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain and Government Cybersecurity Protocols\n\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\u00a0\npublished a damning report\n on the U.S. Government cybersecurity infrastructure, where phrases like \u201cdo not have the resources to combat the current threat environment\u201d and \u201cagencies lack visibility into what is occurring on their networks\u201d are only the beginning.\n\n\nThe porous security can be improved with blockchain. The entire system runs on safe encryption of information, essentially putting a barrier between hackers and identifiable information. Encrypted data, decentralized information storage and publicly-visible ledgers can instill a new set of government cybersecurity priorities. Agencies would be able to quickly identify \npotential hacks\n and trace the manipulated data to its origin. These governments and agencies, in attempting to be among the first governmental blockchain adapters, are pioneering ways to implement DLT into everyday cybersecurity protocol.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe State of Colorado\n\n\nLocation:\n Denver, Colorado\n\n\nThe\u00a0\nColorado Senate\n passed a bill in May 2018 that implores the government to consider blockchain for data protection and the secure storage of records. Colorado reportedly\u00a0\nexperiences six to eight million attempted attacks each day\n, giving the state every reason to implement blockchain\u2019s encryption methods to protect its most vital networks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nLocation:\n Canberra, Australia\n\n\nThe\u00a0\nAustralian government\n is one of the world leaders in governmental blockchain implementation. The country recently prioritized the development of a cybersecurity network that runs on DLT. \nAustralia partnered with IBM\n to create a governmental blockchain ecosystem for securely storing government documents. The country\u2019s federal government hopes this will be seen as a model for other governments going forward.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMalta\n\n\nLocation:\n Valletta, Malta\n\n\nMalta\n is quickly embracing blockchain in its bid to become \u201c\n#BlockchainIsland\n.\u201d The small nation has implemented blockchain cybersecurity measures in its finance sector, and the government is looking into how the ledger technology could be useful in safeguarding government documents and sensitive citizen information.\n\n\n\n"
