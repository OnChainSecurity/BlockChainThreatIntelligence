        "original_content": "A Hacker's Take On Blockchain SecurityOne of the leading factors of the blockchain-aside from the obvious decentralization-is the high level of security behind it. It\u2019s not uncommon to hear people claim that it is \"unhackable.\"\n\nI\u2019m not one to take information at face value and wanted to find out if the blockchain protocol truly was unhackable, so when I had the opportunity to sit down with the Managing Director at Threat Intelligence, Ty Miller, I leapt at the chance to get an expert opinion on the subject.\n\nTo give a little background, Miller is a regular keynote speaker at the Black Hat conferences, which is the most technical and relevant information security event series in the world and he has been heavily involved in the ethical hacking industry for around 15 years.\n\nPROMOTED\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain infancy\nAs any hacker or cybersecurity expert will tell you, the first step when analyzing the security of a protocol is to look at its start.\n\nMiller notes that while blockchain has so far held up to the test of time, it is still a relatively young technology and is almost certainly going to fall to the same fate as every other protocol that has ever been invented.\n\nWhat is this fate, you may ask?\n\n\"Many protocol-based security flaws exist due to either a flaw in the protocol itself, a flaw in the implementation of the protocol, or a flaw in the logic of how the protocol is used by developers.\n\n\nInvesting Digest: Know what's moving the financial markets and what smart money is buying with Forbes Investing Digest.\n\nEmail address \u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\nSign Up\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates\u2019 offerings, ourTerms of Service(including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge ourPrivacy Statement.

Despite being one of the oldest and most critical protocols, there have been serious security flaws that have been released.\"\n\nMiller's \"true story\" example of this is the Bailiwick flaw, which enabled a DNS cache poisoning attack that allowed attackers to hijack arbitrary domains to redirect web and email traffic from the victim. This security flaw needed secret coordinated global efforts across all major software vendors to fix at the same time to prevent malicious threat actors from wreaking havoc on the internet.\n\nBut this is not the only critical flaw present.\n\nSimilarly, SSL is another critical protocol that ensures the privacy of our data as it traverses across the internet, and is one that concerns ethical hackers like Miller. There have been a large number of weaknesses revealed within SSL protocols, their implementations, and their uses.\n\nA classic example was SSL certificates being signed with MD5 hashes, which are known to be flawed. This introduced the ability to generate arbitrary valid and trusted SSL certificates for any website on the internet to allow undetected man-in-the-middle attacks and website spoofing.\n\nIn Miller's opinion, blockchain will be no exception as it becomes more mainstream, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before security professionals and malicious threat actors focus on the protocol.\n\nThe pending risks\nBoth Miller and I agree that transparency within blockchain is a fundamental feature that underlies its trust and validation. But this feature also introduces fundamental risks.\n\nThese risks can be hard to quantify for the general public, however, Miller has done so perfectly.\n\n\"With traditional bank accounts, our transactions and the amount of money in our bank accounts are considered to be very private; however, when blockchain is used with cryptocurrencies, all of our transactions and balances in our wallets can be monitored, which creeps into consumers' private lives.\n\nPrivate blockchains provide a level of security to keep data limited to a certain set of authorized users; however, ultimately the transactions are still public across the entire user base.\"\n\nIn addition, as new concepts for how to use blockchain continue to be developed, we will certainly see unintended consequences where private data is being submitted to the blockchain that can then be monitored or pieced together to become a serious data privacy breach.\n\nSo, what defensive actions are being taken and are they working?\n\nTo prevent privacy breaches through blockchain, encryption may be used to keep data private; however, since this encrypted data on the blockchain is unable to be changed, when a flaw in the encryption algorithm arises, or as computing power continues to become stronger, the encrypted data may then be decrypted to reveal private details.\n\nThis reliance on end users keeping their data secure is fundamentally flawed and is the reason why the majority of cyber attacks performed target end users to compromise their devices and steal their data.\n\nApplications that use blockchain often require the end user to protect their private data themselves, which can go horribly wrong. For example, bitcoin requires the user to protect their digital wallet, or identity applications require the user to protect their own private information store.\n\nUnfortunately, a side effect of this has led to bitcoin banks set up by teenagers managing millions of dollars worth of bitcoins that have been hacked and stolen, and the same is likely to happen with identity data where identity theft can become a serious source of revenue for cybercriminals, making it hard for governments to tax.\n\nAccording to Miller,\n\n\"These types of attacks don't require flaws in the blockchain protocol itself but are caused by the poorly considered application of the protocol across use cases where risks are not thought through properly. The most famous case being the DAO attack introduced due to a duplicate transaction logic flaw in a smart contract implementation that lead to a large amount of money being stolen causing ethereum to \u2018hard fork\u2019 their blockchain history to wipe out the malicious transactions to recover the funds.\"\n\nThe predicted future\nAs computing power continues to grow and cloud-based solutions enable highly scalable computing power, Miller believes that there is the possibility that the \"51% attack\" could be realized, allowing attackers to take control over the blockchain.\n\n\"The more realistic scenario, rather than using scalable cloud-computing power that the attacker needs to pay for, is that the threat actors will utilize botnets to gain access to millions of hacked machines to drive the computing power that they require to pull off a 51% attack,\" says Miller. \n\nWith quantum computing just around the corner, it will be interesting to see how the blockchain is able to deal with hackers, security and identity theft. If Miller is indeed correct, a 51% attack could propose serious consequences for a technology that is still relatively new."
