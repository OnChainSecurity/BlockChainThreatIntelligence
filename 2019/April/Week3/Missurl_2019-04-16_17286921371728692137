If the value of the collateral drops below a certain price, that position is liquidated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smart contracts involved often pay out a reward or fee to the transaction that triggers the liquidation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates MEV opportunities for searchers or block producers running bots to spot this kind of transaction and compete to insert their liquidation transaction in the block ahead of anyone else so that they can gain the liquidation fee for themselves, thereby extracting the reward value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis happens when searchers or block producers with knowledge of the transaction queue or the \u201cmempool\u201d that contains future/pending transactions that are yet to be settled take advantage of this knowledge and place their own transaction before the anticipated transaction(s) is/are placed and settled in other to achieve financial gains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen searchers detect a transaction in the mempool that could be profitable to them (usually large orders) their bot replicates the original transaction but with higher gas fees, prompting miners to choose that transaction over the first one when validating transactions and adding them to new blocks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of different levels of demand across different decentralized exchanges prices for the same tokens may be different across different DEXs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis price discrepancy when wide enough creates an opportunity for MEV extraction. Bots can exploit these situations by buying tokens at a lower price at one exchange and selling them on another exchange at a higher rate.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEX arbitrage is considered the simplest form of MEV opportunity and it is seen as a positive consequence of MEV as it helps maintain, correct and align token prices across exchanges and makes the broader DeFi market more efficient.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere A searcher finds a large trade in the mempool and tries to get in before the particular trade is validated and gets out immediately after the identified trade is validated thus profiting from the temporary and artificial price discrepancy and impact of the large trade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus the searcher or block producer\u00a0 \u201csandwiches\u201d a user\u2019s transaction by submitting one transaction before and one after the user\u2019s transaction. This maximizes profit, again at the expense of unsuspecting users whose trade might be settled at a different price therefore paying a higher rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact Of MEV In Crypto\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEV is a byproduct of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology miners/validators are free to arrange transactions in a block as they see fit.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis freedom, while integral to the blockchain's decentralization tenet, can lead to situations where miners/validators prioritize transactions that offer them the most fees or MEV, potentially at the expense of other network participants.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the incentivized liquidation of collateralized loans helps ensure that lenders get their money back from risky customers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe high competition among MEV searchers in practices like sandwich and frontrunning attacks results in gas fee spikes, network congestions and artificially manipulating token prices thus leading to poor experience for users.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies For Mitigating MEV Exploitation\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few ways to protect yourself from the \u201cinvincible tax\u201d known as MEV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlippage Tolerance: \n\u00a0slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it was executed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA slippage tolerance enables users to set a slippage limit to the amount of price movement they are willing to accept thus helping protect against price manipulation from MEV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas Price Adjustments: \nadjusting the gas price that suit the size of your transaction can help you get prioritised by validators and miners based on how large your transaction is or help you find a balance between speed of execution and cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Platforms with Built-in MEV Protection: \nsome DEXs offer MEV protection to users ensuring that trades of users are executed securely and at the best possible prices.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff-chain transactions and batching: \nThis helps to mitigate MEV occurrences as these transactions are taken off-chain and bundled together and settled in a single batch on-chain.This increases the complexity for miners or validators attempting to extract MEV, thereby protecting users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is going to be quite difficult to completely eradicate MEV since MEV is a result of how blockchain technology works, knowing about it and how to mitigate it is the very first step in avoiding MEV exploitation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, while completely eradicating MEV may prove challenging due to its inherent nature within blockchain technology, awareness and proactive measures are pivotal in mitigating its impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding MEV and adopting strategies to counteract its exploitation are essential steps towards safeguarding the integrity and fairness of crypto transactions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nAuthor\u2019s Note: This article does not represent financial advice, everything written here is strictly for educational and informational purposes.
