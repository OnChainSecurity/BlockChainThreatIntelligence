        "original_content": "Although cryptocurrency can be used for illicit activity, the overall impact of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on money laundering and other crimes is sparse in comparison to cash transactions.\u00a0\n\n\nAs of 2019, only $829 million in bitcoin has been spent on the dark web\n1\n\u00a0(a mere 0.5% of all bitcoin transactions.) Since blockchain technology provides a public record of each transaction, exposure to the risk of financial crime in cryptocurrency including\u00a0\nbitcoin money laundering \nis manageable.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, many MSBs remain unclear about their role in preventing money laundering and other crime on the blockchain, They may not know how to properly implement key AML processes such as \nKnow Your Customer (KYC)\n\u00a0identity verification or they may just feel like the challenges of unmasking criminals is a burden that's not theirs to bear.\n\n\nIn these cases, MSBs may simply look the other way rather than confront the problem.\n\n\nThis is a mistake - and it can be a costly one.\n\n\nWhile criminals will continue attempts to circumvent or exploit bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, money laundering can be headed off at the pass with tools that match customer data with bitcoin transaction histories. This can make it easy for MSBs to identify high-risk customers, remain AML compliant, and avoid the taint associated with crypto money laundering.\n\n\n\n\nHow criminals use crypto to launder dirty money\n\n\nCriminals use crypto money laundering to hide the illicit origin of funds, using a variety of methods. The most simplified form of bitcoin money laundering leans hard on the fact that transactions made in cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous.\n\n\nThe same concepts that apply to money laundering using cash apply to money laundering using cryptocurrencies. There are three main stages of crypto money laundering:\n\n\nPlacement\n\n\nCryptocurrencies can be purchased with cash (fiat) or other types of crypto (altcoin). Online cryptocurrency trading markets (exchanges) have varying levels of compliance with regulations regarding financial transactions.\n\n\nLegitimate exchanges follow regulatory requirements for identity verification and sourcing of funds and are AML compliant. Other exchanges are not as AML compliant, not that they aren\u2019t putting in the effort. It falls more to their ongoing struggle to exceed compliance regulations with sub-par tools. This vulnerability is where most transactions related to bitcoin money laundering take place. When exchanges are regulated, they are required to apply KYC policies and protocols to their customers. This allows for the matching of transaction data to the corresponding customer, thereby breaking the \u2018anonymity\u2019 for each transaction. At Elliptic, we don\u2019t store customer data; instead, we use customer IDs (provided by exchanges) to match to transaction data.\n\n\nHiding\n\n\nCrypto-based transactions can generally be followed via the blockchain. However, once a dirty cryptocurrency is in play, criminals can use an anonymizing service to hide the funds' source, breaking the links between bitcoin transactions. Often, the main excuse for illicit hiding activities is the argument that using anonymizing service providers protect personal privacy.\n\n\nThis can be accomplished both on regular crypto exchanges or by participating in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), where using one type of coin to pay for another type, can obfuscate the digital currency's origin.\n\n\nIntegration\n\n\nThe point at which you can no longer easily trace dirty currency back to criminal activity is the integration point - the final phase of currency laundering.\n\n\nDespite the currency no longer being directly tied to crime, money launderers still need a way to explain how they came into possession of the currency. Integration is that explanation.\n\n\nA simple method of legitimizing the illicit income is to present it as the result of a profitable venture or other currency appreciation. This can be very hard to disprove in a market when the value of any given altcoin can change by the second.\n\n\nAlternately, similar to how an offshore fiat currency bank account can be used to launder dirty money, an online company that accepts bitcoin payments can be created to legitimize income and transform dirty cryptocurrency into clean, legal bitcoin.\n\n\nSome of the most prominent cryptocurrency money laundering cases involve one or more of the following practices:\n\n\nTumblers\n\n\nMixing services, known as \"tumblers,\" can effectively split up the dirty cryptocurrency. Tumblers send it through a series of various addresses, then recombine it. The reassembly results in a new, \"clean\" total (less any service fees, which can often be substantial.)\n\n\nIn most laundering cases, the cryptocurrency starts in a legitimate wallet on the clearnet. It is transferred to a wallet in the dark web making multiple hops before landing in a second dark web wallet. It's at this point that the currency is clean enough to bring back up to the clearnet and traded on a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange or sold for fiat.\n\n\nUnregulated exchanges\n\n\nAnother avenue through which criminals can undertake bitcoin money laundering is unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchanges that are not compliant with AML practices and which fail to perform strict and thorough identity checks allow for cryptocurrencies to be traded over and over again across various markets, deposited onto unregulated exchanges, and traded for different altcoins.\n\n\nThe repeated exchanges of one type of cryptocurrency for another can slowly clean the bitcoin, which criminals can eventually withdraw to an external wallet.\n\n\nIn rare cases, they might convert cryptocurrency into cash, but this is atypical as fiat markets on unregulated exchanges are uncommon with only a brief tenure.\n\n\nPeer-to-peer networks\n\n\nTo lower bitcoin \ncryptocurrency money laundering risk\n, many criminals\n turn to decentralized peer-to-peer networks which are frequently international. Here, they can often use unsuspecting third parties to send funds on their way to the next destination.\n\n\nMost cryptocurrency money laundering schemes end with the clean bitcoin funneled into exchanges in countries with little or no AML regulations. It's here that they can finally convert it into local fiat and use it to purchase luxury or other high-end items such as sports cars or upscale homes.\n\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs\n\n\nThere were\n 5,457 bitcoin ATMs\n worldwide as of September 1, 2019\n2\n. Continually connected to the internet, bitcoin ATMs allow anyone with a credit or debit card to purchase bitcoin. Additionally, they may possess bi-directional functionality allowing users to trade bitcoins for cash using a scannable wallet address. Bitcoin ATMs can also accept cash deposits, providing a QR code that can be scanned at a traditional exchange and used to withdraw bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nRegulations used by financial institutions to obtain a record of customers and transactions for these machines vary by country and are often poorly enforced. Criminals can exploit loopholes and weaknesses in cryptocurrency ATM management to get around bitcoin money laundering risks.\n\n\nPrepaid cards\n\n\nPrepaid debit cards loaded with cryptocurrency provide another avenue for bitcoin money laundering. Prepaid cards can be used to fund different types of illegal activities, traded for other currencies, or handed off along with associated PINs to third parties.\n\n\nGambling and gaming sites\n\n\nOnline gambling and gaming through sites that accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is another way to conduct a crypto money-laundering scheme. Crypto can be used to buy credit or virtual chips which users can cash out again after just a few small transactions.\n\n\nElliptic AML allows users to configure risk rules based on personal appetites for risk. If you consider gaming high-risk, you can set your rules accordingly, and our tool will do the work for you. Elliptic AML monitors crypto transactions from addresses labeled as gaming sites, scores, & flags them alerting you with a rank based on your risk rule configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAnti-money-laundering solutions for MSBs\n\n\nMSBs committed to controlling money laundering will have to comply with legal frameworks in various countries implementing AML requirements. Compliance can help keep MSBs from becoming a front for cryptocurrency money laundering cases reducing bitcoin money laundering risk. Compliance can further cause criminals to shy away, keeping all transactions at the MSB free from the taint of dirty crypto.\n\n\nInsisting on AML process, procedure, and systems centralization and compliance, however, can come with a potential downside: the loss of business with a large contingent of crypto users eschewing such rules and regulations.\n\n\nThe good news is centralization and compliance can easily offset any negativity with the added legitimacy earned by accepting restrictions and \nimplementing AML requirements - such as identity verification for each transaction.\n Additionally, better risk management accompanies adherence to regulations that proactively help mitigate risk exposure.\n\n\nSince hiding and obfuscating transactions are primary methods of cryptocurrency laundering, insisting on a clear record in the blockchain can further thwart money laundering attempts. When there is a clear unbroken trail of verifiable transactions, it becomes much harder to hide the origins of digital currencies.\n\n\n\n\nUS and global approaches to crypto\n\n\nThe United States has a muddled relationship with cryptocurrency. AML requirements for crypto to crypto transactions (as opposed to fiat to crypto or crypto to fiat transactions) have been inconsistent. There are also different thresholds for triggers regarding crypto as opposed to cash transactions.\n\n\nGlobally, AML enforcement, when it comes to cryptocurrency transactions, varies widely \u2013 from relatively strict regulations in the UK, Netherlands, and much of Europe to practically non-existent enforcement in other countries. In June, the \nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) issued a global requirement\n for cryptocurrency-related businesses to collect and share customer identities for each transaction, known as the \nTravel Rule\n.\n\n\nThe \nTravel Rule\n requires crypto exchanges to pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms. Member countries have one year to implement FATF guidelines (with a planned review set for June of next year).\n\n\nThe issuance was an effort by FATF to cut down on money laundering and funding of terrorist organizations.\n\n\n\n\nHow MSBs can help ensure AML compliance\n\n\nWith a strong commitment to the precepts of anti-money-laundering, MSBs can add to their legitimacy while making cryptocurrency cleaning a hard, unattractive pastime for criminals. There are several ways an MSB can become and remain compliant with AML standards, including:\n\n\nHiring an in-house compliance team\n\n\nAn in-house team can help ensure compliance, but this can be expensive and impractical for smaller MSBs. In-house compliance teams will need the support of highly intelligent tools and platforms to help spot potential money laundering in vast datasets or transaction histories.\n\n\nUsing bitcoin AML services and tools\n\n\nDifferent tools and services can help provide different ways to verify the identity of people making cryptocurrency transactions. Automated monitoring of transactions can help identify suspicious patterns that may require a check to ensure AML compliance.\n\n\nDeploying upgraded blockchain technology\n\n\nWith proper use of the immutable ledger for regulatory oversight known as the blockchain, money laundering using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes significantly more difficult.\n\n\nUtilizing \ncrypto and blockchain analytics\n technology for anti-money-laundering transaction monitoring requires matching blockchain transactions with the identities of those making the transactions. Doing so creates an end-to-end trail that can become compliant with AML standards, permitting regulators to examine the records at any time they need to trace specific transactions back to the individual.\n\n\nEstablishing a trustworthy identification system\n\n\nThe cornerstone of anti-money-laundering initiatives is identity verification. FATF\u2019s recommendations will bring identity verification requirements for MSBs in line with those already used by financial institutions.\n\n\nVirtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and MSBs will be required to\n\n\n\n\nIdentify who is sending funds and who is the recipient\n\n\nDevelop ways to share that information when legally required to do so\n\n\nConduct due diligence to ensure customers aren't engaging in illicit activities\n\n\nDeploy risk-based programs suitable for their particular type of business.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating with the Elliptic automated platform\n\n\nElliptic can assist MSBs by instantly and automatically tracing transactions through the blockchain, identifying illicit activities, and providing actionable intelligence to businesses and financial institutions helping ensure \nAML compliance\n and crypto-asset risk management.\n\n\nWith Elliptic, organizations can rest assured that they're meeting important AML compliance requirements and keeping bitcoin (and other crypto assets) out of the hands of criminals.
