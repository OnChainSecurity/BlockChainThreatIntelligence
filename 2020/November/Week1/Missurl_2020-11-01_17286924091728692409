But its transaction-monitoring system was based on an \u201cincomplete set of scenarios which did not enable it to detect certain types of atypical transactions,\u201d the ACPR found.\n\n\nFor example, the bank\u2019s systems would only flag cash deposits by individual customers for further investigation if they exceeded \u20ac14,000 a week\u2014an amount far higher than the average monthly salary in Languedoc.\n\n\nAfter assessing a sample of customer due diligence files related to dozens of high-risk clients, including private banking customers and nonprofit organizations, the ACPR also found that key pieces of due diligence information, such as clients\u2019 sources of wealth and regular income, were frequently missing.\n\n\nThe bank also failed to investigate customers displaying red flags for financial crime, including clients who received transactions that far outstripped their income, or made unusually large cash deposits and withdrawals, according to the regulator.\n\n\nThese all too common failings were far less noteworthy than the fact that they were uncovered through use of an artificial intelligence tool, LUCIA, which the ACPR began deploying last year following several years of tests, and which allowed regulators to collect and analyze 540 gigabytes of data on 750 million transactions.\n\n\nThe technology enabled regulators to analyze payment references, the currencies used and the location of the beneficiaries of transactions and other data, and cross-reference this information with customer due diligence files to identify suspicious financial activity.\n\n\nThe ACPR, for example, identified several customers who made payments abroad via money services businesses and online crowdfunding sites in a manner indicative of terrorist financing, then looked more closely at what controls the bank had in place to mitigate the risks posed by these clients.\n\n\nMatthias Laporte, an inspector with the ACPR who led the LUCIA pilot project, told the regulator\u2019s annual conference in November last year that not only is the tool able to process massive amounts of data, its algorithm is able to recognize new patterns of suspicious activity by itself in ways that data analytical tools based on monetary thresholds and pre-defined transactional scenarios are not.\n\n\nThe ACPR\u2019s sanctions committee, which is responsible for assessing inspection reports and imposing penalties, rejected a complaint from Credit Agricole that a failure by regulators to inform the bank of their intention to use the LUCIA tool when they first requested data from it was unfair and its use \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate.\u201d\n\n\nFlorence Mercier-Baudrier, a former ACPR inspector, told \nACAMS moneylaundering.com\n that tools such as LUCIA will allow supervisors to assess the compliance controls of financial institutions going back for longer periods\u2014for example three years instead of the \u201cstandard\u201d 12-month timeframe\u2014and select \u201cmore and more varied\u201d customer files for closer examination.\n\n\n\u201cBut it will be interesting to see if the use of this tool does not also cause a boomerang effect,\u201d said Mercier-Baudrier, now an independent AML consultant based in Paris. \u201cBecause with this tool, the expectations of the sanctions committee will be higher, and it therefore will be necessary to show more deficiencies [for monetary penalties to be imposed].\u201d\n\n\nContact Gabriel Vedrenne at gvedrenne@acams.org\n\n\n\n"
