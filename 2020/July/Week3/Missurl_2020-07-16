        "original_content": "Avoiding a cryptocurrency scam\nBy Cristina Miranda\nConsumer Education Specialist, FTC\nJuly 16, 2020\nFacebookTwitterLinkedIn\nYesterday some high-profile people had their Twitter accounts hacked by scammers who sent out fake tweets asking followers to send money using Bitcoin - a type of cryptocurrency or digital money.\n\nCryptocurrency scams are now a popular way for scammers to trick people into sending money. And they pop up in many ways. Most crypto scams can appear as emails trying to blackmail someone, online chain referral schemes, or bogus investment and business opportunities. But here\u2019s what they all have in common - and what they have in common with yesterday\u2019s Twitter hacks: A scammer wants you to send money, or make a payment, with Bitcoin or another type of cryptocurrency. Once you do, your money is gone, and there\u2019s generally no way to get it back.\n\nSo if you see a tweet (or a text, email, or other message on social media) that tells you to pay with Bitcoin, you know that\u2019s a scam. Other signs that something\u2019s a scam? They might guarantee that you\u2019ll make money (those guarantees are false); promise that you\u2019ll double your money quickly (again, that\u2019s always a fake promise); or say you\u2019ll get free money in dollars or cryptocurrency (free money? Nope, not ever). \n\nIf you spot a cryptocurrency scam, report it immediately to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint.
