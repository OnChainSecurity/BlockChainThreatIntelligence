        "original_content": "\n\nWith the launch of Ethereum 2.0\u00a0\ntestnet\n\u00a0set to be released on August 4 at 1 pm UTC, the Ethereum Foundation has been looking to build a security team that will be responsible for maintaining ETH 2.0.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity 2.0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe security team\u2019s main point of focus would be to attend to any potential cybersecurity issues and\u00a0\nmaintain the anticipated ETH 2.0 upgrade.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEthereum 2.0 researcher Justin Drake took to his Twitter platform and announced that Ethereum was hiring for\u00a0\nmultiple\u00a0\ntests\n\u00a0that include\n\u00a0fuzzing, bounty hunting, pager duty, applied cryptanalysis, formal verification,\u00a0\nto name a few.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe security team hired by Ethereum Foundation will therefore be responsible for coding\n\u00a0and verifying the cryptographic\u00a0\nalgorithms\n\u00a0behind ETH 2.0. As their duties would include fuzzing, an automated testing software would have to be set up to\u00a0\nmake ETH 2.0 stronger. \u201cFuzzing\u201d refers to a technique used in\u00a0\ncybersecurity\n\u00a0to weed out potential catastrophic bugs that may occur on the network. The\n\u00a0technique involves inputting random, miscellaneous data into the computer program to generate\u00a0\nundesired behavior such as crashes, leaks, and much more. The goal of the cybersecurity team\u00a0\nis to perfect and coordinate all aspects of the network to make ETH 2.0 testnet safer, stronger and more efficient.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReady, Set, Launch - Medalla 2.0 Testnet\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum\u00a0\nMedalla\n\u00a0\ntestnet\n\u00a0is set to launch on August 4, at 1 pm UTC.\u00a0\nFor it to launch, the multi-client\u00a0\ntestnet\n\u00a0needs to fulfill two criteria. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe first is\u00a0\nto achieve \u201cminimum genesis time,\u201d which\u00a0\ndetails\n\u00a0the parameters around the earliest the ETH 2.0\u00a0\ntestnet\n\u00a0can launch. The second criterion that\u00a0\nneeds\n\u00a0to be fulfilled is that there needs to be a minimum number of va\nlidators signed up for the\u00a0\nMedalla\n\u00a0\ntestnet\n. That number is set at 16,385 blockchain users, who all need to make a deposit of 32 Ether coins for\u00a0\nMedalla\n\u00a0to be launched.\u00a0\n\u00a0Also, t\nhe emphasis for\u00a0\nMedalla\n\u00a0is that it is a multi-client\u00a0\ntestnet\n, which means that the trial network is run by the community.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum coordinator Danny Ryan has\u00a0\nannounced\n\u00a0that \u201cthe minimum validator deposits (16k+of them) required to kick off the Medalla\u00a0\ntestnet\n\u00a0were met on Friday.\u201d This means that the genesis of the\u00a0\ntestnet\n\u00a0will happen on Augu\nst 4 at 1 pm, as expected.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Will ETH 2.0 Mainnet Launch?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the\u00a0mainnet\n, the official launch has not yet been confirmed, as software developers need to make sure the blockchain is stable before clearing it for official release. Ethereum researcher Drake has predicted that this will only happen in 2021. However, co-founder and CEO of Ethereum\n,\u00a0\nVitalik\n\u00a0\nButerin\n, seems to be pushing for it to happen this year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO took to his social media platform earlier last week and\u00a0\nexpressed\n\u00a0his wish to see the beginni\nng of phase 1 sooner than later.\n\u00a0\n\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n"
