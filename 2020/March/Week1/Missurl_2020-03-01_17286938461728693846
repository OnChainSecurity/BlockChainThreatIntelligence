In particular, we will examine the products and features of the decentralized exchange as well as discuss its liquidity pools, native utility token, and security.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nBalancer\n is a decentralized exchange (\nDEX\n) platform and one of the leading automated market makers (AMM) in the crypto sector.\n\n\nAfter being in development since 2018, Balancer launched in March 2020 and has swiftly risen to the forefront of the cryptocurrency space. Balancer has quickly established itself as one of the top DEX platforms in terms of both trading volume and locked value, among other metrics.\n\n\nThe decentralized protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain and offers an open, accessible alternative to \ncentralized exchanges\n. In particular, Balancer enables anybody to trade Ether and ERC-20 assets in a trustless, permissionless environment.\n\n\nIn addition, Balancer, like many other current decentralized finance (\nDeFi\n) apps, has its own native utility token (\nBAL\n), dubbed the Balancer token.\n\n\nIn particular, the community-driven protocol offers its users:\n\n\n\n\nThe chance to generate earnings via the usage of its token (BAL), which allows them to contribute to customized liquidity pools;\n\n\nA self-balancing weighted portfolio manager;\n\n\nPrice sensor that enables the decentralized exchange of tokens;\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA Liquidity provider;\n\n\nAutomatic portfolio management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compliant systems.\n\n\n\n\nBalancer homepage. Source: balancer.fi\n\n\n\n\nWhy do people use Balancer?\n\n\nBalancer has over \n$3.4 billion\n in liquidity and over \n17,500 liquidity\n \nproviders\n (LP), not to mention these LPs have made over \n$70 million\n in collecting fees. Notably, people use Balancer because it offers several critical integrations in its protocol, such as the following:\n\n\n\n\nReduced gas fees;\n\n\nEnhance capital efficiency:\n\n\nEnabled arbitrage with zero-tokens starting capital;\n\n\nAccessibility to custom AMMs.\n\n\n\n\nDue to its decentralized nature, Balancer is focused on serving investors and traders who wish to swap their assets or offer liquidity without the need for intermediaries.\u00a0\n\n\nUltimately, Balancer serves everyone, including both \nLiquidity Providers\n and\n traders\n.\n\n\nFor instance:\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity providers who are also known as market makers benefit by collecting trading fees, while their portfolios are regularly rebalanced.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTraders, on the other hand, have access to an open, decentralized exchange that is never closed, allowing them to trade whatever they want, anytime they want, for competitive fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n[advertisement]\n\n\n\n\nBalancer offers a number of benefits that distinguishes it from the competition, such as:\n\n\n\n\nThe degree of freedom and control it affords to pool owners;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancer is one of the few AMMs that directly rewards traders for using the platform. Users get BAL tokens in proportion to the median gas price and the current ETH/BAL exchange rate at the time of their transaction for qualified swaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen swaps are done via pools for which they offer liquidity, Balancer liquidity providers receive fees, much like most other AMMs. The fee is dispersed proportionally to the LPs stake in the pool.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than paying a broker to rebalance the pool, the pools receive fees when they are rebalanced continually by traders doing swaps. Additionally, pools with a large token count benefit from having a large number of token pairings, which provides more possibilities to earn trading fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple asset pools are supported by Balancer, which allows pool owners to incorporate as many as 8 different assets in their pools. Pool managers can build full portfolios that are automatically rebalanced by traders. Since transactions do not need to be routed via Ether (ETH), they are less susceptible to slippage for traders.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBalancer for investors\n\n\nBalancer allows you to invest and manage your portfolio like a professional, without the hassle or expense. The investor-friendly protocol handles assets algorithmically by swiftly rebalancing positions and earning trading fees over time.\n\n\nBalancer investors. Source: balancer.fi\n\n\nAdditionally, Balancer\u2019s various pool designs enable over 25,000 investors to choose the optimal arrangement for their investment objectives with benefits such as:\n\n\n\n\nPlug and play:\n Thousands of individual and institutional investors have utilized Balancer\u2019s simple portfolio setups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximize fee earnings:\n Dynamic fee pools use market conditions to alter trading fees and maximize investor earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility and choice: \nBalancer enables experienced investors to choose the amount of exposure to each asset in their portfolio and to establish bespoke price curves, allowing them to create an endless number of strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissionless platform: \nNon-custodial protocols like Balancer allow investors to manage their own money, rather than relying on a centralized team or third party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAL token rewards:\n The Balancer platform rewards investors that deposit assets into incentivized liquidity pools with payouts of $BAL token liquidity mining dividends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity-minded:\n With the safety of investors in mind, Balancer\u2019s smart contracts have been rigorously tested to prioritize the protection of investors\u2019 funds.\u00a0 Balancer also has a history of security audits by leading businesses, as well as a bug bounty of 1,000 ETH, which they claim is the highest in the industry.\n\n\n\n\nBalancer for Traders\n\n\nTraders may benefit from Balancer\u2019s efficient trading by aggregating crowdsourced liquidity from investor portfolios and utilizing its Smart Order Router to discover the best available price for them to trade at. Exchange any combination of ERC-20 tokens without the need for authorization and with simplicity.\n\n\nThe Balancer Protocol is an open financial marketplace that allows traders to transact in real-time while maintaining security. Users can trade right away without any restrictions or the need to create an account or get anyone\u2019s permission to do so.\n\n\nIn addition to the ability to trade thousands of token pairings at lightning speed and at the best possible prices, the decentralized liquid crypto market provides other benefits such as:\n\n\n\n\nNo Gas\n: On the platform\u2019s new Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol (CowSwap) trading interface, you may take advantage of free signature trades (no gas is needed), MEV protection, and the best rates across DeFi exchanges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEV Protection:\n Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is shielded from traders on Balancer, which would otherwise result in increased gas fees and extra price slippage for DEX traders if not protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancer vault efficiency: \nBalancer enables traders to retain a token balance inside the protocol, so trades may be executed without departing the Balancer vault, which is ideal for high-frequency traders since it reduces the cost of gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+$3.4 billion in liquidity: \nTrades of any size on Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, or Polygon may be certain that they will be priced competitively thanks to the liquidity of the Balancer\u2019s market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser controls funds:\n With Balancer, traders don\u2019t have to hand up control of their assets to a third party; user funds are always in the hands of the account holders themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-capital arbitrage: \nFlash swap allows traders to perform arbitrage trades that rebalance liquidity pools while also sending gains straight to the trader, all without spending any tokens on the Balancer platform.\n\n\n\n\nWatch the video\n: \nUsing BGP for the Best Trading Experience\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Balancer\n\n\nBy using Balancer\u2019s stable, open-source, permissionless protocol, users in the cryptocurrency space may develop new and creative sorts of financial dapps.\n\n\nInstead of concentrating on low-level accounting, developers can prioritize new AMM logic with over 50 DeFi integrations in \nfour steps\n.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Smart Pool;\n\n\nLaunch a token;\n\n\nUse Balancer Data;\n\n\nUse price oracles.\n\n\n\n\nBuild on Balancer. Source: balancer.fi\n\n\nCustomizable AMM logic\n\n\nSmart Pools are dynamic liquidity pools whose parameters may be altered by modifying the smart contract\u2019s code. Pool owners can define who is permitted to participate in the pool. Furthermore, Balancer\u2019s open-source code allows you to innovate without restriction.\n\n\nIn addition, Balancer V2 Smart Pools will be available in the near future. Multiple tokens, configurable weights, and the ability to establish your own swap fees are all available. You may create your own unique Weighted Pool on Balancer V2 in only four simple steps.\n\n\nWatch the video: \nCreate a Custom Weighted Pool in Balancer V2\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\n\nLaunch a token\n\n\nFor a fair and liquid launch, Balancer has in place a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP), which is an adjustable Balancer Smart Pool that is intended for the distribution and price discovery of new assets. Essentially an LBP\u2019s weight is configured to change constantly throughout the token sale.\u00a0\n\n\nThis also offers benefits such as:\n\n\n\n\nFree & permissionless;\n\n\nCapital efficient;\n\n\nEquitable distribution.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBalancer key products\n\n\nBalancer is redefining the notion of decentralized exchanges by providing users with five key products to help them get the most out of their trading experience.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vault\n;\n\n\nBalancer Pools\n;\n\n\nSmart Order Router\n;\n\n\nMerkle Orchard\n;\n\n\nBalancer Gnosis Protocol\n.\n\n\n\n\n1. The Vault\n\n\nBalancer\u2019s central component is the Vault; it is a smart contract that stores and controls all tokens in each Balancer pool. On top of being a crucial part of Balancer, the Vault also serves as the gateway via which most Balancer operations (swaps, joins, and exits) are carried out.\u00a0\n\n\nAccounting and token management are separated from the pool logic in Vault. Pool contracts become simpler since they no longer need to manage assets actively; they merely need to compute swaps, joins, and exits.\u00a0\n\n\nThis architecture has the following benefits:\n\n\n\n\nA variety of pool designs may be accommodated by this architecture, which is agnostic to pool math and can work with any system that meets a few parameters,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to create your own decentralized exchange;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnybody who has an innovative concept for a trading system may create a bespoke custom pool that is directly connected to Balancer\u2019s current liquidity.\n\n\n\n\nBalancer V1 and V2. Source: balancer.fi\n\n\nGas efficient batch swaps\n\n\nMulti-hop trading (A->B->C) may become expensive on other decentralized exchanges when token accounting is combined with pool logic since ERC20 tokens must be transferred at each hop.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, the Vault contract stores all tokens, giving Balancer an edge; it allows for better swap switch efficiency as the Vault only transfers tokens at the input and output of a multi-hop deal, saving gas by reducing token transfers.\n\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to execute swaps without any token transfers. Since the Vault can keep track of balances for arbitrary Ethereum addresses, just as it does for pools, users may store Internal Balances in the Vault and make trades to and from these balances.\n\n\nVault Security\n\n\nThe Vault keeps pool balances independent, which is crucial for a permissionless system where anybody may generate their own tokens and pools. This independence prevents malevolent or carelessly designed tokens or custom pools from draining cash from other pools.\n\n\nAs a result, even if the Vault holds aggregated liquidity of a certain token from numerous pools, the depth of that combined liquidity does not influence individual pool prices.\n\n\nBalancer flash loans\n\n\nWhen it comes to pricing impact on a per-pool basis, the consolidated liquidity in the Vault has no effect; nonetheless, it allows Balancer Protocol to leverage that combined liquidity by issuing Flash Loans.\u00a0\n\n\nFlash Loans are uncollateralized loans that must be returned (plus interest) in the same transaction they were obtained. Formalized assurances prevent borrowers from escaping with tokens since everything must be completed in a single transaction.\u00a0\n\n\nIf two Balancer Pools\u2019 prices differ, anybody may execute a Flash Swap. A Flash Swap arbitrageur does not need to possess any of the input tokens required to conduct a deal. Instead, the trader finds the imbalance, instructs the Vault to perform the swap and profits.\n\n\n\n[advertisement]\n\n\n\n\n2. Balancer Pools\n\n\nSmart contracts called pools are the building elements of the Balancer Protocol, and they determine how traders may exchange tokens on the platform. The versatility of Balancer Pools sets them apart from other systems.\n\n\nUnlike other exchanges, which have pools with predefined specifications, Balancer supports pools of any composition and underlying math. Due to Balancer\u2019s open design, anybody may create their own pool type, allowing for flexible pricing options and functions.\n\n\nFurthermore, \nWeightedPool2Tokens\n and \nMetaStable Pools\n both provide optional Oracle functionality, allowing them to be utilized as sources of on-chain pricing data.\n\n\nThe following is a list of the many pool choices available on the Balancer Protocol for various token combinations:\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Pools:\n Designed for wide use, including tokens that do not necessarily have a price connection (for example, DAI/WETH).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStable Pools: \nSuitable for soft-pegged tokens with a high correlation coefficient (for example, DAI/USDC/USDT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaStable Pools:\n Designed to support non-pegged tokens that preserve correlation but may diverge over time, such as the derivative (e.g., stETH/WETH).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity Bootstrapping Pools:\n Useful for changing the liquidity of one token into another (e.g. AKITA/ETH).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Pools:\n Built to provide maximum flexibility in order to manage a dynamic fund. Including weight shifting to rebalance, swap pausing, and management fees. (For instance, WSBDapp).\n\n\n\n\n3. Smart order router\n\n\nThe Smart Order Router (SOR) helps Balancer traders discover the best pricing. The SOR identifies the best trades for a given set of input and output tokens if that is a straight swap in a single pool or a mix of transactions traveling across many pools.\n\n\nThe SOR increases in tandem with the expansion of the diversity of Balancer Pools. Furthermore, the SOR continues to grow as additional pool types with unique math are introduced.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result, the Balancer ecosystem\u2019s many pools can all execute trades. By connecting and integrating with the SOR, any custom pool created on Balancer may use Balancer\u2019s liquidity.\n\n\nBalancer Smart Order Router. Source: balancer.fi\n\n\nThe SOR is built to generate an arbitrage-free state between the pathways it uses in order to acquire the best price for a trader. To accomplish this, each path the SOR takes must offer the same spot price when the swap is complete.\n\n\n4. Merkle Orchard\n\n\nWeekly Liquidity Mining distributions are claimed using the MerkleOrchard contract. The contract allows Liquidity Providers to claim tokens from the contract.\u00a0\n\n\nA Merkle root of the accumulated token amounts is checked against these assertions. Whatsmore, claiming via the MerkleOrchard saves a lot of gas, particularly when claiming numerous weeks of rewards and multiple tokens.\n\n\nFor more advanced use cases, like depositing tokens straight into liquidity pools, the contract permits claim to callback contracts. Lastly, the Balancer community is strongly encouraged to develop unique user interfaces that facilitate this process.\n\n\nAny user may contribute their tokens to the MerkleOrchard in order for them to be claimed. In order to promote liquidity mining on pools of interest, Balancer anticipates that users will utilize it as a standard utility for delivering ERC20 tokens to any number of receivers.\u00a0\n\n\nIn its current state, the MerkleOrchard is being used to distribute BAL and other tokens from various initiatives designed to encourage pool liquidity on the protocol.\n\n\n5. Balancer Gnosis Protocol\u00a0\n\n\nThe Balancer Gnosis Partnership (BGP) is the default trading interface on app.balancer.fi.\u00a0\n\n\nBGP employs Gnosis Solvers and the Balancer Vault to perform trades in batches, and traders submit swaps using Gnosis Solvers by simply signing a message to initiate a gasless transaction.\n\n\nTo safeguard traders for Miner Extractable Value (MEV), the solvers match transactions first using on-chain liquidity, enabling them to take advantage of Coincidence of Wants.\n\n\nTo guarantee traders always receive the best price, BGP uses many Decentralized Exchanges. However, its strong integration with Balancer\u2019s Vault enables it to perform sophisticated multi-hop deals with minimum token transfers, substantially lowering transaction costs.\n\n\n\n[advertisement]\n\n\n\n\nFinally, since BGP groups gasless transactions together, unsuccessful trades do not result in a fee loss.\n\n\nCoincidence of Wants (CoWs) is an economic occurrence in which peer-to-peer transactions are settled directly between participants without the need for an AMM, avoiding slippage and fees.\u00a0\n\n\nOn Gnosis v2 platform CowSwap, users may purchase and sell tokens using gasless orders that are settled peer-to-peer or into any on-chain liquidity source while protecting MEV.\u00a0\n\n\nUser savings are realized by eliminating the requirement for an external market maker or liquidity provider, which means gas costs, slippage tolerance, and protocol fees may be reduced.\n\n\nThe following are some of the advantages of using BPG:\n\n\n\n\nMEV security;\n\n\nCompetitive on-chain pricing ;\n\n\nFailed transactions will not incur any gas costs;\n\n\nTrades that do not use gas;\n\n\nProfessional third-party transaction management.\n\n\n\n\nWatch the video\n: \nBalancer-Gnosis-Protocol\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nThe Balancer Governance Process allows anyone with BAL voting power to vote on proposals. Essentially the Balancer Protocol\u2019s governance makes choices on new features and the direction the protocol should evolve. Ultimately, governance is the final authority, and no one may overrule the outcomes of a vote.\n\n\nTo put it simply, the Balancer Governance Process follows an idea from its inception through debate, proposal, voting, and finally enactment. It is intended to be an open, transparent, and intuitive method of advancing the protocol\u2019s future development openly and honestly.\n\n\nBalancer Governance Votes take place on Snapshot, which is an off-chain gas-free multi-governance client that produces easily verifiable and difficult-to-contest results.\n\n\nBalancer Governors have the authority to activate and change the Governable Protocol Fees charged to traders. The Protocol fees may be collected via trading fees and flash loan fees and kept in the Vault.\u00a0\n\n\nOn top of deciding what happens with the fees, the Governors have the authority to choose how they should be spent to best promote the development and performance of the protocol.\n\n\nBAL Governance Token\n\n\nTokenization is a common feature in many current DeFi apps, and Balancer is no exception. When you provide liquidity or trade on the Balancer Protocol, you may earn the BAL token, which is utilized for participation in the governance of the Balancer Protocol.\n\n\nBAL holders, also known as Balancer Governors, are responsible for voting on proposals that are pertinent to the protocol.\u00a0\n\n\nTrading Fees\n\n\nBalancer Pools are highly customizable, so each pool can charge a different fee. The amount of fees charged is entirely up to the discretion of the pool\u2019s developer, with fees ranging from \n0.0001% to 10%\n. When using the Smart Order Router, the fees will always be taken into consideration when determining the optimum price to be offered.\n\n\nTrading fees:\n A tiny proportion of each transaction paid by traders to pool LPs, established by the pool developer or dynamically optimized by Gauntlet. Moreover, the Balancer governance may vote to implement a Protocol Trading Fee, which is a proportion of the Trading Fee.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[advertisement]\n\n\n\n\nSuppose a pool charges a 1% cost and governance institutes a 1% protocol fee; the overall swap fee charged to the trader remains at 1%, but 0.99% of the fee is distributed to the pool\u2019s LPs, and 0.01% is allocated to the protocol fee collector contract.\n\n\nNote:\n At launch, all protocol costs were set to zero and may be altered solely via governance.\n\n\nFees for Flash Loans:\n A modest fraction of the assets utilized to fund flash loans from Balancer\u2019s Vault. This is the protocol fee; it is collected by the protocol and distributed by governance.\n\n\nAll Balancer conversations and decisions are determined democratically through Governance \nSnapshot voting\n. The Community is made up of people who care about the protocol\u2019s growth and development. Discussions are conducted on the \nBalancer Discord\n, while implementation and policy changes are debated on the \nGovernance Forum\n.\n\n\nBalancer snapshot. Source: balancer.fi\n\n\nYou can find other community pages on other networking platforms such as:\n\n\nSecurity\u00a0\n\n\nThere are no admin keys or backdoors on the Balancer Protocol, which makes it completely trustless, and you cannot upgrade the Balancer pools. Tokens that do not correspond to the ERC-20 standard are not supported by Balancer, despite being in use on certain pools.\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, Balancer does not have control over the tokens held on Balancer pools; instead, they are smart contracts. However, this does not eliminate the inherent dangers associated with smart contracts.\n\n\nTo guarantee that tokens with known flaws are not utilized in pools, the configurable rights pools (CRPs) are in place. It also guarantees that all other tokens may interact with the protocol in a secure manner.\n\n\nFully audited\n\n\nSecurity is of the utmost importance to Balancer, which is why the platform has undergone \naudits\n with Certora, OpenZeppelin, and Trail of Bits.\n\n\nBalancer Pool Hack\u00a0\n\n\nAn issue occurred that allowed an attacker to siphon cash from two pools containing tokens with transfer fees (sometimes referred to as deflationary tokens).\u00a0\n\n\nBalancer had frequently cautioned about the unforeseen consequences of ERC20s with transfer fees in its docs, discord, and other channels. This is precisely why STA was excluded from the compiled BAL mining whitelist.\u00a0\n\n\nThe system is built for ERC20-compliant tokens, and when tokens act in unexpected ways, negative consequences might occur. Balancer is a permission-less system, which means that malicious or faulty tokens may always be introduced at the contract level.\n\n\nBalancer in response:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTransfer fee tokens have been added to the UI\u2019s blacklist.\u00a0\n\n\nAdded further documentation about the dangers associated with how these pools operate and how tokens that are faulty or maliciously constructed might possibly drain funds from a pool.\u00a0\n\n\nContinues to audit and evaluate the protocol on a continuing basis.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, Balancer reimbursed the liquidity providers who had lost funds and continues to offer bug bounties.\n\n\nBalancer Pros & Cons\n\n\nBalancer is a fully decentralized market maker protocol;\nAnyone can create liquidity on any particular token;\nReduced gas fees;\nCustom AMMs;\nA balancer multi-asset pool allows pool owners to integrate up to eight different assets in their pool, allowing for more diversification;\nUsing multi-asset pools, pool managers have the ability to build comprehensive portfolios that are automatically rebalanced by traders.\nThe concept of the platform and connecting another wallet is difficult for beginners in crypto;\nMalicious transfer tokens can still be added as it is a DEX;\nMore educational material could be provided so users know how to use the platform step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nFinally, Balancer is a well-known decentralized exchange platform that is establishing itself as a new generation of cryptocurrency trading interfaces that does away with accounts and order books entirely.\u00a0\n\n\nIn contrast to centralized exchanges, the new automated market maker offers an open and easily accessible alternative. Balancer, like many other AMM platforms, route trades via whichever liquidity pools are required to achieve the best rate for the customer, which means swaps may be either direct or indirect in nature.\n\n\n\n[advertisement]\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Balancer meets its aim to serve investors and traders who wish to swap their assets or offer liquidity without depending on centralized intermediaries, and the platform accomplishes its goal.\n\n\nFAQs about Balancer\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Balancer?\n \n\n\n\n\nBalancer is an automated market maker and decentralized exchange based on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform values assets in a liquidity pool based on their ratio. Adding or removing liquidity from one side of a pool affects the pool ratio and hence the price of each asset, so\u00a0 Balancer trades via whatever liquidity pools are available to ensure the user receives the best pricing possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I use Balancer?\n \n\n\n\n\nThere are three ways to participate in Balancer: trading supported tokens against one other, creating liquidity pools to increase the balancer protocol\u2019s liquidity, or investing in pre-existing liquidity pools to make a profit from trades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the fees for using Balancer?\n \n\n\n\n\nBalancer Pools may be configured in a variety of ways, and each pool can charge a different fee. The pool developer determines the fee structure, which might range from 0.0001 % to 10%. While utilizing the Smart Order Router, fees are always included when determining the optimal pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is BAL cryptocurrency?\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Balancer token (BAL) is the official native utility token of the Balancer Protocol. The token is utilized to participate in governance of the Balancer Protocol and when you provide liquidity or trade on the Balancer Protocol, you may earn BAL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
