        "original_content": "Top 10 Blockchain Security and Smart Contract Audit Companies\nBy Michael Gu -May 14, 2020\nWe rank the top 10 performing blockchain security firms offering services such as smart contract audits, blockchain security analysis, penetration testing, formal verification, and security audits. Security audits are extremely important - this year we\u2019re seeing the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)- a new application of decentralized Blockchain technology that is poised to replace the trillion dollars Global Finance industry. However, recent events such as the dForce hack have shown us that hackers can exploit weaknesses in smart contracts and steal money. It\u2019s almost like robbing a bank, except in this case the bank is flush with crypto AND can\u2019t defend itself. In the case with dForce, the hacker stole $25,000,000 USD (talk about a good haul) and with crypto transactions, we know this is not reversible.\n\nConsequently, security solutions, tailored to the volatile nature of blockchain technology and its components, have started making moves to isolate and neutralize security threats common in the blockchain terrain. In this article, I will highlight and explore the workings of the top companies in the blockchain security niche.\n\nIt is therefore extremely important for security audits of projects, exchanges and blockchains to be done. Users must also know what security tests have been performed and if any red flags were raised.\n\nHacken\nWebsite: https://hacken.io/\n\nHacken performs a wide range of security services for its clients. These suites of services include blockchain security consulting, web/mobile penetration testing, coordination of bug bounty programs, crypto exchange ratings, among other things. Although Hacken offers a long list of services targeted at blockchain and crypto firms, its ecosystem, however, encompasses security products ideal for IT companies as a whole. The company has built a commendable reputation as a security risk assessment for companies requiring a digital environment to create or enable services for their consumers.\n\nHence, it comes as no surprise that Hacken has provided security services for non-blockchain giants like Air Asia. Furthermore, it has proven its commitment to blockchain technology by sponsoring and engaging security experts worldwide in security meetups.\n\nHacken has also created the HackenAI security platform designed to protect the end user from security risks and account compromises. Key features such as Darknet monitoring immediately alerts users of compromised passwords and possible darknet attacks. HackenAI is available on Android and Iphone devices.\n\nQuantstamp\nWebsite: https://quantstamp.com/\n\nQuantstamp is a blockchain security startup unveiled at YCombinator W18 Batch. The security team of Quantstamp has experience in top IT companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple. And this is evident in the platform\u2019s wide array of blockchain security tools and services. For one, Quantstamp has developed a decentralized security network for smart contract auditing. With this solution, users can perform automated smart contract security review on a \"global network of decentralized security nodes.\"\n\nAdditionally, the platform provides expert security audits for clients blockchain projects and a 24/7 security monitoring software tool.\n\nTrail of Bits\nWebsite: https://www.trailofbits.com/\n\nTrail of Bits prides itself as a network of developers with the capabilities of identifying and fixing loopholes in software, devices, or codes. In other words, the solution provides an array of software security services that encompass smart contract audits, blockchain security research, software development, and so on. Over the years, Trail of Bits has developed formidable security tools for smart contracts. Some of these blockchain-focused solutions are Crytic, Slither, and Echidna.\n\nApart from that, Trail of Bits developed the popular AlgoVPN. As well, it has a lot of security publications on GitHub, including public reports for 0x Protocol, Compound, NuCypher, and MakerDAO, which are some of its clients.\n\nOpenZeppelin\nWebsite: https://openzeppelin.com/\n\nThe OpenZeppelin team is mostly known for its development of Solidity libraries known as OpenZeppelin Contracts. These libraries are used in most Solidity projects as a tested and standard template for contracts deployable on decentralized applications. Developers can integrate this solution through OpenZeppelin\u2019s native SDK. Besides development, OpenZeppelin has a strong focus on smart contract security and audit services.\n\nAlso, OpenZeppelin was one of the first teams to reinvent blockchain security by introducing elements of gamification to identify loopholes in smart contracts. Another of its products, Ethernaut, is a Web3/Solidity war game, which entails gamers to hack smart contracts to move to the next level.\n\nConsenSys Diligence\nWebsite: https://diligence.consensys.net/\n\nUS-based ConsenSys is one of the biggest and prominent blockchain incubators in the industry. Unlike other security firms mentioned on this list, ConsenSys dedicates its resources and technological know-how to the development of Ethereum blockchain applications and software, especially financial infrastructures. As such, its product, ConsenSys Diligence, offers security analysis for smart contracts. This audit product is at the cutting edge of sophisticated \"cryptography, blockchain technology, and crypto-economic incentive analysis.\"\n\nAnother of its products, MythX, is one of the most powerful automated scanners for Ethereum smart contracts. This solution provides a robust API, which developers can use to access security analytics tools.\n\nCertik\nWebsite: https://certik.io/\n\nCertik is a security company looking to utilize topnotch formal verification technology in collaboration with some of the best cybersecurity experts to create end-to-end services. On its website, Certik claims that it has audited over 188,000 lines of codes and secured over $6.32 billion worth of assets. The team offers to mathematically validate the safety of smart contracts\n\nTherefore, it has developed Certik Chain, a public blockchain focused on leveraging Certik\u2019s Formal Verification platform, to secure decentralized projects. Certik is officially a partner company of Binance, and it is backed by prominent investors, including Binance Labs, Lightspeed, Matrix Partners, and DHVC.\n\nLeastAuthority\nWebsite: https://leastauthority.com/\n\nLeastAuthority is a cybersecurity consulting firm with its main focus on privacy.
