        "original_content": "Cryptocurrency has gotten lots of attention as a new way to invest. But here\u2019s the thing: scammers are taking advantage of people\u2019s understanding (or not) of cryptocurrency investments, and how they work. And younger people are losing big.\n\n\n\n\n(View or share the\u00a0\nYouTube version\n\u00a0of this video.)\n\n\nIn fact, \nthe FTC\u2019s new data spotlight \nshows that, since October 2020, nearly 7,000 people reported losses to bogus cryptocurrency investments, adding up to more than $80 million. People ages 20-49 were more than five times more likely than other age groups to report losing money on those scams. But here\u2019s an even more striking point: people in their 20s and 30s have lost more money on investment scams than on any other type of fraud. And more than half of their reported \ninvestment scam\n losses \u2014 $35 million \u2014 were in cryptocurrency.\n\n\nCryptocurrency investment scams can happen in many ways, but they\u2019re all full of fake promises and false guarantees. Scammers might post investment sites that look real, but you\u2019ll find you can\u2019t withdraw the money you\u2019ve \u201cinvested.\u201d Others pretend to be celebrities \u2014 like a would-be Elon Musk \u2014 doing giveaways with claims of multiplying any cryptocurrency you send. Scammers also use online dating sites to sweet-talk people into bogus crypto investments in the name of love.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about investing in cryptocurrency:\n\n\n\n\nResearch before you invest. Search online for the company and cryptocurrency name, plus \u201creview,\u201d \u201cscam,\u201d or \u201ccomplaint.\u201d\n\n\nBe wary of guarantees and big promises. Scammers often promise you\u2019ll make money quickly, or that you\u2019ll get big payouts or guaranteed returns. They might offer you free money paid in cash or cryptocurrency \u2014 but, even if there\u2019s a celebrity endorsement, don\u2019t buy it. You\u2019ll make money if you\u2019re lucky enough to sell your crypto for more than you paid. Don\u2019t trust people who say they know a better way.\n\n\nAnyone who says you have to pay by \ncryptocurrency\n, \nwire transfer\n, or \ngift card\n is a scammer. If you pay, there\u2019s usually no way to get your money back.\n\n\n\n\nRead more at \nftc.gov/cryptocurrency\n. Need to report a cryptocurrency scam? Visit \nReportfraud.ftc.gov\n.\n\n\n\n"
