Double spending involves overwriting entries in the blockchain ledger, either changing the destination of a transaction or reversing it. \n\nIn the second attack, hackers netted about $1.7 million after employing the same method as the previous attack-renting hashpower from Nicehash provider daggerhashimoto, according to a Bitquery analysis. Prior to those attacks, Ethereum Classic was afflicted by a similar 51% attack in January 2019.\n\nAD\n\nHow ETC Labs is tackling 51% Attacks\nFollowing the first two hacks in August, ETC Labs announced that they were working on a security plan for the Ethereum Classic network.\n\n\nThe plan includes a series of \"defensive mining measures to both try to alert ourselves to impending attacks and deploy hashpower to prevent them,\" Culver explained. Ethereum Classic Labs is also working with exchanges to tell them to increase their confirmation times, he added.\n\nETC Labs has enlisted the help of New York-based international law firm Kobre & Kim to pursue the individuals responsible for the attacks. According to Benjamin J. A. Sauter, a partner at the law firm, the attacks did not occur due to any technical issue with Ethereum Classic, but were the result of a group acting maliciously to commit fraud.\n\nThe crypto industry is full of hackers.

For the third time in August, hackers gained control of the Ethereum Classic blockchain in a 51% attack that reorganized over 7,000 blocks.  Though Ethereum Classic developers are rushing to protect the blockchain from future attacks, these three attacks raise concerns over the network\u2019s security. OKEx, for instance, has considered delisting the coin to protect itself from future losses.
