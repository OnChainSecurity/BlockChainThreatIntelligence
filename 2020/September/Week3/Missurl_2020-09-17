        "original_content": "The $55M Hack That Almost Brought Ethereum Down\n\nMatthew Leising\nUpdated September 17, 2020 21 min read\n\n\nIn This Article:\nBTC-USD\nETH-USD\nIOT-USD\nXVG-USD\nPART-USD\nBloomberg News reporter Mathew Leising\u2019s new book, \"Out of the Ether: The Amazing Story of Ethereum and the $55 Million Heist That Almost Destroyed It All\", tells the story of the infamous DAO hack that almost brought down the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain.\n\nIn June 2016, a here-to-now unknown assailant (or assailants) began syphoning off funds from Ethereum\u2019s first decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, a bit of software that functions like a corporation. Weeks earlier the DAO went live, following a $150 million crowd sale.\n\n\n\"[T]he DAO had a huge part to play in the early history of Ethereum,\" Leising writes. \"It\u2019s not overstating it to say that the DAO made Ethereum.\" That\u2019s because it was one of the earliest examples that Ethereum\u2019s network of computers was resilient enough to support complex applications.\n\nRelated: Ethereum Gas Fees Drive Gnosis-Powered Prediction Market to xDai's Layer 2\n\nSee also: David Siegel - Understanding The DAO Attack\n\nWhile the attack never broke Ethereum\u2019s code - it merely exploited a loophole in The DAO\u2019s smart contract - it cast doubt over the viability of a blockchain-based \"world computer.\" It was also the beginning of Ethereum\u2019s two Ethereums.\n\nLeising, who has been covering the crypto industry for the better half of a decade, had called out sick from work the day a hacker absconded with $55 million in stolen ETH. But he didn\u2019t let the story die. Over the past four years he has been reporting out the story told in the book, examining blockchain data, following through on cryptic tips and ultimately tracing a path towards his leading suspect.\n\nIn the excerpt below, readers find themselves in eastern Germany along with Christoph Jentzsch, one of The DAO\u2019s principle architects, who woke up to realize the project he has spent months building is being robbed \"at the rate of about $8 million an hour.\"\n\n\nRelated: First Mover: Federal Reserve Does What It Wants to Do as Bitcoin Hits $11K\n\nA religious family man, Jentzsch takes this extemporaneous moment to reflect on the challenges that faced the DAO\u2019s creation - from securities worries that still plague token projects to the critical opinions of the early Ethereum community - before taking action. - Dan Kuhn\n\nChapter 7\nThe town of Mittweida in the state of Saxony in Germany escaped being bombed in the Second World War. In the middle of town, old stone streets divide rows of brightly colored buildings. If you leave the town square and walk for about 10 minutes you\u2019ll come to a quiet street with a police station; next door is a mint-green house with brown trim and shutters. On Friday, June 17, 2016, just after 8 a.m., Christoph Jentzsch lay on the beige carpet of the first-floor office inside. He tried to still his breathing, to take deep breaths, to not let the world get away from him. Thieves were inside the DAO, his creation, robbing it at the rate of about $8 million an hour.\n\n\n"
