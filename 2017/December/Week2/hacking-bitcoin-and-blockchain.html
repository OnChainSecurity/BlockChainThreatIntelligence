        "original_content": "Hacking bitcoin and blockchainBoth bitcoin and blockchain are vulnerable to attack. Here's what you need to know to protect yourself and why blockchain is becoming a foundational technology.It is hard to turn on the television or read a tech blog without getting inundated with stories about bitcoin or blockchain. The biggest reason bitcoin is so popular is its nearly 2,000 percent increase in price over the last year, which made its underlying blockchain technology popular as well, even though blockchain is probably the better long-term bet.\n\nBlockchain technology is poised to significantly impact our world. In early 2017, the Harvard Business Review suggested that blockchain \"has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems\" [emphasis mine]. A January 2017 World Economic Forum report predicted that by 2025 10 percent of global GDP will be stored on blockchains or blockchain-related technology. If you don\u2019t know about a technology that\u2019s predicted to be 10 percent of GDP in under a decade, you probably should start to learn about it.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\nBlockchain is a digital log file, cryptographically protected, that secures online transactions. First conceptualized in 1991, bitcoin was the first application to put a distributed, public blockchain into practice. A block is a digital recording of a transaction record, and whatever the blockchain participants agree is needed to validate the transaction. Usually it contains transaction data such as price, action (buy, sell, transfer, etc.), and a timestamp. Every transaction (or series of transactions) creates a block. Each future block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block (these days the hash is usually SHA-256). In this way, each transaction block is cryptographically locked to the previous block.If that blockchain is publicly distributed, like bitcoin is, then each participant can verify any transaction in the blockchain. You may not know how much money or wealth a participant has, unless that is included in the transaction record, but you can see the value exchanged between two participants and be able to verify its validity. Any participant can prove the ownership of a particular blockchain account by presenting cryptographic proof that would be very hard to fake (i.e., non-trivial in crypto-speak), but is easy to verify by all participants. The way blockchaining works can be likened to public/private key cryptography, where each participant has a private key that can create signed content that can be easily verified by all the other participants using a related public key.\n\nYou can have public, private, and hybrid blockchains, just like in cloud computing. You can create your own, use other blockchains from larger groups with shared interests, or even participate in a public global blockchain, like bitcoin. Although this is a relatively newer functionality, private blockchains can participate with public blockchains, and vice-versa.\n\nBitcoin to blockchain\nMost people\u2019s first introduction to blockchain was bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency created by a person or group with the nom de plume \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" in 2008 (I\u2019ll use the pronoun of \"he\" when referring to Nakamoto even though I believe it was probably a group and not an individual). Nakamoto didn\u2019t invent the concept of blockchain, but he did introduce the concept of distributed blockchaining for decentralized ledgering and verification of transactions around digital currencies. This solved the inherent \"double spending\" problem of decentralized digital currencies without trusted third parties.Nakamoto published a paper on metzdowd.com\u2019s The Cryptography Mailing list in October 2008 called Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. In 2009, he generated the first block of blockchain and software that anyone could download and cryptographically generate (i.e., mine) a bitcoin. The author of this article downloaded the software during the first few days and quickly generated three bitcoins.\n\nAlthough the hype and promise of the eventual value of bitcoin was present from the beginning, the first \"official\" transaction valued 10,000 bitcoins for about $20 in pizza. Today, bitcoins are worth substantially more, over $16,000 at this writing, with regular, huge volatility swings. The substantial, rapid price increase has gotten the attention of investors and financial sector corporate CEOs, although not usually with affirmation. Many investors are likening bitcoin\u2019s price increases to the famous Dutch tulip bubble in the 1600s, with some investors getting very rich while naysayers stay on the sidelines watching their friends get rich.\n\nThe way bitcoin, the software, and the distributed network is created, each slew of newly generated bitcoins makes it incrementally harder to generate the next bitcoin. So, what used to take part of day with one computer now takes thousands of specialized, hardware-specific \"miner\" computers combined into aggregated networks weeks to months to generate. Today, it takes so much electrical energy to generate bitcoins that the measures are compared to total global electricity use on a regular basis.By design, it takes not only a huge amount of computing power to create a bitcoin, but also, even though not in the same realm of effort, a lot of computational effort to create and validate a bitcoin transaction. Further, each transaction adds to the size of the blockchain, which continuously grows over time (bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is well over 100 GB), which must be generated and distributed to all participating parties to remain valid. Eventually, a maximum of 21 million bitcoins will be mined by 2140. This self-induced crypto-scarcity is part of what is fueling bitcoin\u2019s stratospheric price rise."
