The three victims of the attack identified are:\nSwarm City\n\u00e6ternity blockchain\nEdgeless Casino\nParity says the vulnerability affected the contract used to create multi-signature Ethereum wallets in Parity version 1.5 or later, warning its users to move their Ether from their in-browser wallets to more secure accounts immediately.\nWhite Hat Hackers Group Holds $75 Million Worth of Ethereum#\nethereum-cryptocurrency-hack\nYes, 377,000 more Ether worth over $75 Million were also drained by white hat hackers.\nAs the attack began, a group of white hat hackers used the same exploit to drain approximately 377,000 Ether from other vulnerable wallets into holding accounts in order to protect them from black hat hackers, Coindesk reports.\nCybersecurity\nThe Whitehats are currently holding the rescued funds and has promised to return the funds to their owners once this security threat passed.\n\"The White Hat Group were made aware of a vulnerability in a specific version of a commonly used multisig contract. This vulnerability was trivial to execute, so they took the necessary action to drain every vulnerable multisig they could find as quickly as possible,\" White Hats wrote on Reddit.\n\"We will be creating another multisig for you that has the same settings as your old multisig but with the vulnerability removed and we will return your funds to you there.\"\nThe company has just released an updated version of the Parity software fixing the vulnerability."
