Their approach\nis interesting because the tests are not .t files and are in their own\nrepository. They have helper contracts for different roles, a lot of\nutilities, and also make use of hevm (which, ngl, haven't looked deep into\n:D). Writing PoCs was a pleasing experience because all of the contracts had\nbeen already deployed in Utility.sol and interacting with them was easy."
