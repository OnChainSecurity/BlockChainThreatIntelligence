One share of the Fund is represented by one BENJI token and the Fund\u2019s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes blockchain technology for transaction activity. As of March 31, 2024, the Fund held over $360 million in assets under management.\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited that BENJI token holders will have the ability to transfer shares amongst each other,\u201d said Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton. \u201cEventually, we hope for assets built on blockchain rails, such as the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, to work seamlessly with the rest of the digital asset ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\nThe Fund offers a competitive yield and is a regulated 1940 Act fund that invests at least 99.5 percent of its total assets in government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by government securities or cash. The Fund\u2019s investment objective is to provide investors with as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of shareholders\u2019 capital and liquidity and aims to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.\n\n\nIndividual investors can gain exposure to the Fund in digital wallets through the Benji Investments app, available in mobile app stores for \nAndroid\n and \niOS\n devices.
