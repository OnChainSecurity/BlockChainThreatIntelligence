It strikes me as a blindingly obvious use case for ZKPs and/or DIDs -- but how can the crypto community (defined broadly**) make it happen? \n(*If you need a pass, use code HOCHSTEINRBQ11 for 20% off.)\n(**No, this does not involve issuing tokens and idk if you even need a blockchain -- just ZKPs and/or DIDs, technologies that have arguably developed as a positive spillover effect of crypto. Yes, it has positive spillover effects!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                General Counsel @ Wormhole Foundation | Building Crypto Infrastructure | Leader | Advisor | Angel Investor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      4 \n  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading back to Austin next week for Consensus 2024! I'll be co-moderating a town hall with one and only \nMarc Hochstein\n where we will be leading a super important discussion on balancing protection of minors from inappropriate and addictive online content with ideals we in the Web3/crypto community hold dear: privacy and free speech. \n\nWe'll be joined by \nBeatrice O'Carroll\n, \nJessica Darmoni\n, \nAlex Fowler\n and \nSebastian Rodriguez\n to tackle these issues and how the work being done in the Web3/crypto space can be leveraged to protect vulnerable members of our society while also preserving the ideals which guide us daily. \n\nThank you, \nCoinDesk\n, for highlighting this important issue at Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n"
