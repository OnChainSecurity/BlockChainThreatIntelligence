Despite these improvements, the data confirms the continued presence of security threats in the crypto industry.\nEthereum, the blockchain with the largest number of active users and Total Value Locked (TVL), bore the brunt of these losses. It witnessed approximately $1.35 billion worth of losses distributed across roughly 170 incidents. Meanwhile, the BNB Chain incurred losses totaling $110.12 million in 213 separate incidents.\n\nDisclaimer: Includes third-party opinions.
