However, the basis for much of the internet has remained rooted in a client/server-based paradigm, where organizations provide services and applications in exchange for ownership \u2014 partial or whole \u2014 of the user data posted to those systems.\nA growing number of people are exploring what the internet could look like if it were a decentralized system in which users own, manage, and store their own data and collectively participate in hosting and running applications. Many have taken to calling this shift in internet paradigms \u201cWeb3.\u201d\nThis publication:\nProvides a brief background on the internet\nExplores some of the concepts behind Web3\nExplores some of the proposed technologies that could be used\nDescribes some security and privacy concerns that should be kept in mind as Web3 is explored\nNIST requests feedback on the technical descriptions, proposed technologies, and security and privacy analyses of Web3. \nThe public comment period is open through May 27, 2024.\n See the \npublication details\n for a copy of the draft and instructions for submitting comments.\nNOTE: A call for patent claims is included on page ii of this draft.

Users would own and manage their personal data, and systems would be decentralized and distributed. Digital tokens would be used to represent assets, and web-native currencies (such as cryptocurrencies) would be used for payments. This document provides a high-level technical overview of Web3 and discusses the technologies that are proposed to implement it. The integration of these developing technologies may present novel security challenges, so this paper presents security considerations that should be addressed when considering Web3 technology and adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Web3 is a proposed vision for the future of the internet that is restructured to be more user-centric with an emphasis on decentralized data.
