        "original_content": "\n\n\nCyberattacks have more than doubled since the pandemic. While companies have\nhistorically suffered relatively modest direct losses from cyberattacks,\nsome have experienced a much heavier toll. US credit reporting agency\nEquifax, for example, paid more than $1 billion in penalties after a major\ndata breach in 2017 that affected about 150 million consumers.\n\n\n\n\nAs we show in a chapter of the April 2024 \nGlobal Financial Stability Report\n,\nthe risk of extreme losses from cyber incidents is increasing. Such losses\ncould potentially cause funding problems for companies and even jeopardize\ntheir solvency. The size of these extreme losses has more than quadrupled\nsince 2017 to $2.5 billion. And indirect losses like reputational damage or\nsecurity upgrades are substantially higher.\n\n\n\n\nThe financial sector is uniquely exposed to cyber risk. Financial\nfirms\u2014given the large amounts of sensitive data and transactions they\nhandle\u2014are often targeted by criminals seeking to steal money or disrupt\neconomic activity. Attacks on financial firms account for nearly one-fifth\nof the total, of which banks are the most exposed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidents in the financial sector could threaten financial and economic\nstability if they erode confidence in the financial system, disrupt critical\nservices, or cause spillovers to other institutions.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a severe incident at a financial institution could undermine\ntrust and, in extreme cases, lead to market selloffs or runs on banks.\nAlthough no significant \u201ccyber runs\u201d have occurred thus far, our analysis\nsuggests modest and somewhat persistent deposit outflows have occurred at\nsmaller US banks after a cyberattack.\n\n\n\n\nCyber incidents that disrupt critical services like payment networks could\nalso severely affect economic activity. For example, a December attack at\nthe Central Bank of Lesotho disrupted the national payment system,\npreventing transactions by domestic banks.\n\n\n\n\nAnother consideration is that financial firms increasingly rely on\nthird-party IT service providers, and may do so even more with the emerging\nrole of artificial intelligence. Such external providers can improve\noperational resilience, but also expose the financial industry to systemwide\nshocks. For example,\n\n\na 2023 ransomware attack\n\u00a0on a cloud IT service provider caused simultaneous outages at 60 US credit\nunions.\n\n\n\n\nWith the global financial system facing significant and growing cyber risks\nfrom increasing digitalization and geopolitical tensions, as shown in the\nchapter, policies and governance frameworks at firms must keep pace.\n\n\n\n\nBecause private incentives may be insufficient to address cyber risks\u2014for\nexample, firms may not fully account for the systemwide effects of\nincidents\u2014public intervention may be necessary.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, according to an IMF survey of central banks and supervisory\nauthorities, cybersecurity policy frameworks, especially in emerging market\nand developing economies, often remain insufficient. For example, only about\nhalf of countries surveyed had a national, financial sector-focused\ncybersecurity strategy or dedicated cybersecurity regulations.\n\n\n\n\nTo\n\n\nstrengthen resilience\n\u00a0in the financial sector, authorities should develop an adequate national\ncybersecurity strategy accompanied by effective regulation and supervisory\ncapacity that should encompass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Periodically assessing the cybersecurity landscape and identifying\n    potential systemic risks from interconnectedness and concentrations,\n    including from third-party service providers.\n    \n\n\n\n    Encouraging cyber \u201cmaturity\u201d among financial sector firms, including\n    board-level access to cybersecurity expertise, as supported by the\n    chapter\u2019s analysis which suggests that better cyber-related governance\n    may reduce cyber risk.\n    \n\n\n\n    Improving cyber hygiene of firms\u2014that is, their online security and\n    system health (such as antimalware and multifactor authentication)\u2014and\n    training and awareness.\n    \n\n\n\n    Prioritizing data reporting and collection of cyber incidents, and\n    sharing information among financial sector participants to enhance their\n    collective preparedness.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAs attacks often emanate from outside a financial firm\u2019s home country and\nproceeds can be routed across borders, international cooperation is\nimperative to address cyber risk successfully.\n\n\n\n\nWhile cyber incidents will occur, the financial sector needs the capacity to\ndeliver critical business services during these disruptions. To this end,\nfinancial firms should develop, and test, response and recovery procedures\nand national authorities should have effective response protocols and crisis\nmanagement frameworks in place.\n\n\n\n\nThe IMF actively helps member countries strengthen their cybersecurity\nframeworks through policy advice, for example as part of the\n\n\nFinancial Sector Assessment Program\n, and through\n\n\ncapacity-building\n\u00a0activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014This blog is based on \nChapter 3\n of the April 2024 Global Financial\nStability Report, \u201cCyber Risk: A Growing Concern for Macrofinancial\nStability.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
