        "original_content": "To Our Valued SQUID Game V2 Community and the Attacker, In light of the recent\nflash loan attack on our swap contract that led to a significant loss of\nliquidity, we find ourselves at a critical juncture. The sellSwappedTokens\nfunction exploit has deeply impacted our community, draining $87K worth of\nSQUID Game V2 liquidity. This incident has not only tested our resolve but\nalso highlighted the vulnerabilities that we, as a decentralized project, are\nworking tirelessly to mitigate. Our commitment remains unwavering to ensure a\nsafe and secure environment for our token holders, reflected in our proactive\nsteps to prevent such vulnerabilities. In response to the attack, we reached\nout to the Binance Security Team, seeking assistance to identify the attacker,\nas the wallet used in the attack was funded through a Binance Hot Wallet.\nBinance has informed us that cooperation with private parties is limited\nwithout the involvement of law enforcement agencies. They have advised us to\nengage with law enforcement, who can then coordinate with Binance through\nofficial channels for further investigation and recovery efforts. At this\njuncture, we extend an appeal to the attacker: we urge you to reconsider your\nactions and return the stolen liquidity. By doing so, you can prevent further\nescalation of this issue to law enforcement authorities. We are prepared to\nresolve this matter peacefully and focus on rebuilding and securing our\ncommunity's trust and investment. To our community, we share your pain and\nfrustration. This setback is not the end of our journey; it is a call to\naction. We are exploring every avenue to recover the lost liquidity and\nstrengthen our project against future threats. Your support and patience\nduring these challenging times is invaluable. Together, we can overcome this\nadversity and emerge stronger. Let us unite in our efforts to secure the\nfuture of SQUID Game V2 and uphold the principles of trust, security, and\ncommunity that define us.\n\n[@0xNickLFranklin](/0xNickLFranklin)\n\n[@CyversAlerts](/CyversAlerts)"
