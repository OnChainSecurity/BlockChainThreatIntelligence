It examines the security risks and threats that are unique to blockchain, and then introduces key blockchain security controls, alongside business controls and conventional security controls. Finally, the article illustrates a blockchain security reference architecture and security model that can be used to secure any blockchain solutions.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you review the solutions that you design and architect against this blockchain security model to ensure that all measures are in place to adequately secure your blockchain solutions.\n\nBlockchains -- not immune to cyber-attacks\nBlockchain is a shared, replicated, and permissioned ledger with consensus, provenance, immutability, and finality. The shared ledger ensures that participants can decide which assets to share, and enables them to know the identity of the other participants that they are dealing with. Blockchain also provides participants with provable endorsement, which comes with confidentiality -- information shared only on a need-to-know basis.\n\nIt's no secret that blockchain and blockchain applications are not immune to cyberattacks and fraud. Addressing and examining the key security issues/risks for blockchain helps ensure the security of blockchain solutions.\n\nSecurity risks associated with blockchain-based solutions\nSecurity is about risk management, so it's important to start with an understanding of the risks associated with blockchain solutions. The specific risks of a blockchain solution depend on the type of blockchain being used. Let\u2019s take a look at the various types of blockchains with decreasing levels of risk and increasing levels of security:\n\nPublic blockchains are public and anyone can join them and validate transactions. They are generally more risky (for example, cryptocurrencies). This includes risks where anyone can be part of the blockchain without any level of control or restrictions.\n\nPrivate blockchains are restricted and usually limited to business networks; membership is controlled by a single entity (regulator) or consortium.\n\nPermissionless blockchains have no restrictions on processors.\n\nPermissioned blockchains allow the ledger to be encrypted so that only relevant participants can see it, and only those who meet a need-to-know criterion can decrypt it.\n\nThere are a number of other risks with blockchain solutions, and they can be broadly categorized into three areas:\n\nBusiness and governance: Business risks include financial implications, reputational factors, and compliance risks. Governance risks emanate primarily from the decentralized nature of blockchain solutions, and require strong controls on decision criteria, governing policies, identity, and access management.\n\nProcess: These risks are associated with the various processes that a blockchain solution requires in its architecture and operations.\n\nTechnology: The underlying technology used to implement various processes and business needs may not always be the best choice, and this can ultimately lead to security risks.\n\nSome of the examples of these risks are captured in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Risk category and associated risks with description\n\nCategoryRiskRisk description and examples\nBusiness and governanceDecision makingA blockchain solution has a decentralized governance process that creates risks around lack of control over policy compliance and decision making.\nAccess controlsLack of centralized governance can also cause reduced control over who can access the platform and the level of access provided to every user. This can be a larger issue if members have different ways of categorizing users in their respective organizations.\nFinancialFinancial risks in a blockchain solution come primarily from risk of fraud transactions and critical data loss due to potential security breaches.\nAudit, legal, and compliance risksCertain operations on the platform may rely on data that is stored on-chain or validated by data on-chain. This can cause challenges with compliance regulations and compliance with system and application audits. It can also introduce legal risks that define the liability of the data in question.\nProcessIdentity and access management (IAM)Unauthorized access to the platform can result in dire consequences for members with critical data loss, suspension of operations, and denied access. Lack of IAM can also cause incorrect invocation of certain smart contract functions.\nSecure communicationsInsecure communications between different nodes within the solution or between the solution and external components may result in misdirection, which in turn can lead to transport-level security issues. This can also raise challenges related to access permissions and threats from insider attacks.\nVulnerable solution (untested codes)Untested codes or solutions that come through non-DLT-certified processes or methodologies can be vulnerable to hacking and may impact the overall business and operability of the solution.\nBlockchain identity keys on hardware security module (HSM)When using a shared HSM for storing blockchain identity keys, a set of keys for one organization can potentially be mixed up with those of another organization.\nInfrastructure securityThe underlying infrastructure that is deployed for architecting a blockchain solution can have numerous issues, including unnecessary access and unwanted packets trying to get into the network.\nTechnologyStorage, expiration, and malfunctioning of keysBlockchain identity keys and transaction tokens are an important component of the solution. Challenges with certificate and key expiration, renewal, archive, and revocation can bring huge risks to the functioning of the platform.\nApplication securityThe blockchain itself is immutable and tamper-proof, but the applications that leverage the network pose challenges at every level.\nValidation and authentication of shared ledgerIt is important to understand the validity and the authenticity of the shared ledger. This is also an emerging technology and associated risks are sometimes unknown.\nRisks in smart contractsSmart contracts are an important component of a blockchain solution, and any logical flaws in the implementation of these contracts or their transactions can result in validation of incorrect contracts or transactions.\nRisks with deletion, auditability, and consensusIt is important to consider the risks of deleting parties when one party leaves the consortium and apply the appropriate procedures. The distributed network setup in blockchain is prone to auditability and consensus risks.\nIt is important to analyze the risks highlighted above in order to then derive a risk model for the blockchain-based solution. Some key considerations for designing a blockchain solution include:\n\nWhat are the specific features that are unique to blockchain?\nWhat is the governance model for participating organizations/members?\nWhat data will be captured in each block?\nWhat are the relevant regulatory requirements and how can they be met with blockchain?\nHow are the details of identity managed? Are block payloads encrypted? How are keys managed and revoked?\nWhat is the disaster recovery plan for the blockchain participants?\nWhat is the minimal security posture for blockchain clients for participation?\nWhat is the logic for resolving blockchain block collisions?\nBlockchain security threat models\nThe security of a solution should also be evaluated in the context of its threat model. Blockchain, by nature, has robust record integrity guarantees, however a number of things can go wrong in other parts of a blockchain-based application that can lead to compromise and loss. Some examples include weak access controls, loose key and certificate management protections, and insufficient communication security. The key to properly securing such an application is to develop a comprehensive threat model for it and mitigate identified weaknesses.\n\nOne well-known model is the Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service attacks, and Elevation of privilege (STRIDE) model that is used to study relationships between the actors and assets, review threats and weaknesses related to these relationships, and propose appropriate mitigations.\n\nBlockchain applications often incorporate external components -- Identity and access management (IAM) systems, multi-factor authentication (MFA), public key infrastructure (PKI), and regulatory and audit systems -- that are owned and managed by actors. These systems need to be carefully scrutinized before they can become part of the overall solution as they are developed or controlled by third parties. These should be taken into consideration for the threat model in a blockchain solution.\n\nFigure 1 takes into consideration the various factors and derives a threat model that can be applied in a blockchain-based implementation."
