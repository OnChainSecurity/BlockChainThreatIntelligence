But in 2023, hackers stole just $1.1 billion from DeFi protocols,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"This amounts to a 63.7% drop in the total value stolen from DeFi platforms year-over-year. There was also a significant drop in the share of all funds stolen accounted for by DeFi protocol victims in 2023.\"\n\nIn spite of the drop, several incidents drew headlines throughout 2023, including:\n\nEuler Finance - $197 million loss;\nCurve Finance - $73.5 million loss;\nMixin Network - $200 million loss;\nCoinEx - $43 million loss;\nPoloniex Exchange - $130 million loss;\nKyber Network - $54.7 million loss;\nHTX - $113.3 million loss.\nJuly 2023 alone saw 33 different hacks, the most of any month, the researchers explained.\n\nCybersecurity experts who spoke to Chainalysis said many of the hacks occurred because platforms are poorly built, prioritizing growth over robust security systems.\n\n\"Historically, the majority of DeFi hacks have stemmed from vulnerabilities in smart contract design and implementation - a large proportion of the affected contracts we examined had either not undergone any audit or had been audited inadequately,\" said Mar Gimenez-Aguilar, lead security architect and researcher at blockchain cybersecurity firm Halborn.\n\nBut Gimenez-Aguilar noted that things are improving, with many DeFi protocols increasing security measures.\n\nChainalysis said it is likely a mix of lower overall DeFi activity and better security practices that contributed to the decline in losses last year.\n\n\"Although the total amount stolen from crypto platforms in 2023 was down significantly from prior years, it is clear that attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse in their exploits,\" Chainalysis said.\n\n\"Over time, as these processes improve, it is likely that funds stolen from crypto hacks will continue to decline.\"\n\nScreen Shot 2024-01-24 at 3.04.52 PM.png\nImage: Chainalysis\n\n$1 billion for North Korea\nOne important part of the crypto hacking ecosystem is the activity of threat actors from North Korea, which have pilfered billions from crypto platforms to help fund their government and its nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn 2022, North Korean cyber espionage groups like Kimsuky and Lazarus Group stole about $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency. That figure fell to $1 billion in 2023 but the number of incidents attributed to the nation grew to 20, the highest ever recorded.\n\nAbout $428 million was stolen from DeFi platforms while exchanges, wallet providers and centralized services also saw hundreds of millions worth of losses.\n\nAttacks on Atomic Wallet, Alphapo and Coinspaid were all attributed to North Korean hackers, according to U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n\nChainalysis said the hackers behind the attacks took great effort to obfuscate the funds, sending them to centralized exchanges and then to other platforms where they could be mixed with other funds and converted into other cryptocurrency.\n\nThe hackers used the now-sanctioned mixing service Sinbad to obscure the on-chain transactions. Several other platforms and services, like the Tron blockchain and Avalanche bridge, were used to further launder the money.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council recently asked researchers at cybersecurity firm Phylum to provide them with information on North Korea\u2019s efforts to use cryptocurrency thefts as a way to circumvent sanctions.\n\nLouis Lang, co-founder of Phylum, told Recorded Future News that the UN was particularly interested in Lazarus Group\u2019s attacks and noted that they have seen multiple campaigns from the group.\n\n\"DPRK cyberattacks account for nearly 45% of their military budget. If memory serves, $3.7 billion in cryptocurrency was stolen in 2023, nearly half of that was the result of DPRK cyberattacks,\" Lang said.\n\n\"In the campaigns we\u2019ve been monitoring, [Lazarus Group] is just different because the motivations are different. The group wants to obtain cryptocurrency, so they target financial and cryptocurrency institutions directly. They\u2019ve been very successful in this case.\""
