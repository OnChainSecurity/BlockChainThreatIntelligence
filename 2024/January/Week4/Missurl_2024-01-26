        "original_content": "PEPE Team Denies Connection to Suspicious Wallet Transaction\nFormer $PEPE team members, who once misappropriated 16 million, have resurfaced, engaging in unauthorized activities.he actions in the $PEPE deployer wallet, including the suspicious transaction, are not associated with the current $PEPE team, as clarified in an official statement.\n\nThe transactions are linked to former team members who had previously misappropriated 16 million from the $PEPE treasury and have resurfaced to engage in unauthorized activities. Notably, Eric Wallace (known by various aliases including cryptocap, abundantpeaks, and PvP prayers) along with Chris Frick (also known as zerozevia and turbo) and his brother Brandon Frick, are identified as the actors behind these transactions. \nEric Wallace has likely adopted a new identity, as his previous accounts are now inaccessible. The Frick brothers have been pictured alongside Chase Hero and the Logan Paul LA influencer crew. \nThe community is urged to remain vigilant, and it is crucial to dissociate the current $PEPE team from these unauthorized actions."
