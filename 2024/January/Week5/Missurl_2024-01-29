In some cases, the teams behind these platforms also contact law enforcement agencies and even reach out to the hackers themselves, attempting to negotiate a return of funds. \n\nMost recently, crypto exchange Poloniex tracked down the identity of the hacker that stole $120 million. Poloniex\u2019s majority shareholder Justin Sun sent the hacker\u2019s wallets blockchain messages, offering a $10 million \"white hat\" bounty in exchange for the funds. \n\nIn this instance, the hacker did not respond to the demands, but Poloniex managed to freeze a portion of the funds associated with the hackers address, mitigating the total amount lost to some extent.
