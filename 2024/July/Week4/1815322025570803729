They're the kind of people who meticulously track every cent\nto make sure they're not overpaying. But, due to a rounding error, they end up\nrepaying more than they borrowed. Initially, this might seem like a minor\nhiccup \u2013 a few extra pennies here and there. However, this small error creates\na loophole ripe for exploitation. Imagine this: the rounding error causes Jane\nand Roy's repayment to be recorded as slightly more than what they actually\npaid. Over time, if this happens repeatedly with multiple users, the contract\ncould end up with an inaccurate balance sheet, showing more funds repaid than\nactually received. This discrepancy can be exploited by savvy users to\nmanipulate the contract, potentially draining it of funds or allowing them to\nrepay their loans at a discount. Rounding errors might seem trivial, but in\nthe world of finance, every penny counts. Here\u2019s how we can address this issue\nwith Solidity:\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTFRJceWgAAhh2v?format=jpg&name=medium)](/ShieldifySec/status/1815322025570803729/photo/2)\n\nTo avoid such scenarios, precision in calculations is key. Let's add a more\nsecure way of handling repayments to prevent rounding errors:\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTFQIs_X0AEwDc6?format=jpg&name=medium)](/ShieldifySec/status/1815322025570803729/photo/1)\n\nThe Fix ? To ensure precise\ncalculations, always use a fixed-point arithmetic library or ensure that all\namounts are handled as integers representing the smallest unit (like wei for\nETH). Additionally, consistently validate that operations do not result in\nunintended overflows or underflows.\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTFQokJWIAAnd_Y?format=jpg&name=medium)](/ShieldifySec/status/1815322025570803729/photo/3)\n\nIn this contract, we use OpenZeppelin\u2019s SafeMath library to handle the\narithmetic operations securely, preventing any overflows or underflows. This\nensures that the totalDebt is always accurate, and Jane and Roy can repay\ntheir loan without worrying about losing extra pennies to rounding errors. Now\nthey can focus on enjoying their home without stressing over their loan\nrepayments. ?Wrapping Up:\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Building an \"unhackable\" money market is a\nHerculean task. While we can fix these issues, it still might not be truly\nunhackable in the end. However, taking these precautions can significantly\nreduce the risk of being exploited. From re-entrancy to solvency checks, each\npiece of the puzzle plays a crucial role in securing your contract. Let\u2019s\ncontinue another time with more of the \u201cunhackable\u201d bank."
