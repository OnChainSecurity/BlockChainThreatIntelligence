Let's review the progress made this semester\nin this post ?\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTbX886XQAEzUoW?format=jpg&name=medium)](/zarosfi/status/1816881412093473071/photo/1)\n\nFor the full detailed article, please refer to this link:\n[https://mirror.xyz/zarosfi.eth/iKfW-\nTIx5s9FcOY9auKFt9Hzl8QX6HjXHGDnwW-2XJs\u2026](https://t.co/NFXQiIGaI6)\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Testnet Launch On\nFebruary 28th, we launched Zaros' testnet on Arbitrum Sepolia. After months of\ndedicated development, it was the first opportunity for the community to\nexperience and test our platform. With over 6,000 users and 30,000 trades, we\nare now preparing for the mainnet launch in H2 2024. We will also be live on\n\n[@monad_xyz](/monad_xyz)\n\ntestnet and mainnet upon their launches.\n?\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Trading League &\nzPoints Boost  On May 27th, after three months of active testnet, we launched\nthe Zaros Trading League Pre-Season. This event allowed our traders to\nshowcase their skills. The Pre-Season has been the best way to maximize\nzPoints, with top traders earning multipliers and more zPoints for each task.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Zaros Documentation\nIn H1 2024, we released our initial documentation on Gitbook. The document\nincludes detailed information about Zaros, such as an explanation of our\narchitecture, what differentiates us from other protocols, how the Perpetuals\nDEX and LP module work, tokenomics, the zPoints system, tutorials, and\nadditional resources to help you understand and navigate Zaros. It's important\nto note that as the market and Zaros evolve, we will continuously update the\ndocumentation to reflect the latest developments.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Fundraising In the\nfirst half of 2024, we successfully raised $1.8 million from prominent\ninvestors who share our vision of creating a next-generation perpetual futures\ndecentralized exchange, powered by boosted (Re)Staking vaults on\n\n[@Arbitrum](/Arbitrum)\n\nand\n\n[@monad_xyz](/monad_xyz)\n\n.\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTbYSQ5XgAABeIu?format=jpg&name=medium)](/zarosfi/status/1816881412093473071/photo/2)\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 ZRS Launch One of the\nmost exciting milestones in H1 2024 was the launch of our token,\n[$ZRS], on May 29th. We initially launched\n[$ZRS] through\n\n[@FjordFoundry](/FjordFoundry)\n\n's Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) system, allowing the community to\npurchase [$ZRS] on the platform. Following\nthe LBP period, [$ZRS] was listed on\n\n[@Balancer](/Balancer)\n\n, which currently provides the deepest liquidity, and on\n\n[@MEXC_Official](/MEXC_Official)\n\n, for CEX users. To learn more about what makes\n[$ZRS] different from other tokens, make\nsure to check this thread:\n[https://x.com/zarosfi/status/1816503985001619742\u2026](/zarosfi/status/1816503985001619742)\n![6\ufe0f\u20e3](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/36-20e3.svg) DAO Establishment In\nJune, we initiated applications for the community to join the Zaros DAO\nCouncil, marking a significant milestone in the decentralization of the\nprotocol. We received numerous applications, including submissions from\nVenture Capital Analysts, DAO members from other DeFi protocols, experts from\nleading smart contract auditing firms, members of investment DAOs, early\ninvestors in Zaros, and many dedicated community members. We conducted a\ntransparent voting process to select the five members of the first Zaros DAO\nCouncil. These council members will execute community-voted decisions over the\nnext six months, serving as the executive arm of the organization.\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTbYc9cXkAAuPwD?format=jpg&name=medium)](/zarosfi/status/1816881412093473071/photo/3)\n\n![7\ufe0f\u20e3](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/37-20e3.svg) Entering the Monad\nEcosystem One of the most exciting developments this semester was our decision\nto expand Zaros to the Monad blockchain. While Monad is not yet live, we are\ncommitted to launching on day one of both its testnet and mainnet. We have\nalso updated our branding to align with the \u201cMonad Vibe,\u201d which you can see\nreflected on our website and Twitter/X account. We deeply appreciate the\nsupport of the Monad community. Many community members have actively\nparticipated in discussions about the protocol, providing valuable insights.\nWe have also joined a Twitter Spaces session with the Monad team and the\n\n[@monadians_xyz](/monadians_xyz)\n\n, our partners, and one of the most exciting NFT projects in the Monad\necosystem.
