This four-week event aims to enhance the security of the Ethereum protocol through a large-scale crowdsourced security audit competition. Our goal is to raise over 2 million USD for the reward pool, the EF has seeded the pool with an initial 500,000 USD.\n\n\n\n\nHelp Support Ethereum Security\n\n\n\n\nWe invite the entire Ethereum community \u2014 from projects to individual developers \u2014 to participate in this important event. Contributions to the reward pool will directly enhance the security of the Ethereum ecosystem, fostering a safer environment for  users and developers.\n\n\n\n\nThe sponsorship program will close on August 1, 2024, after which the final reward pool will be locked, and further details of the Attackathon will be announced. Community members can join the sponsorship program \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nJoin us in our efforts to secure the Ethereum Protocol and help make this our largest Attackathon yet.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an Attackathon?\n\n\n\n\nThe Attackathon is a time bound audit challenge to bolster the security of the Ethereum protocol. It begins with an educational phase where participants receive instruction on the protocol\u2019s code via live technical walkthroughs and educational content from the Attackathon Academy. This phase ensures that participants are well-prepared to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Attackathon, security researchers will actively search for vulnerabilities in the protocol\u2019s code. They will follow specific rules set for the competition, and only impactful and rule-compliant reports will be rewarded. This phase focuses on real-time problem-solving and applying the knowledge gained during the initial phase.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Attackathon, Immunefi will evaluate and compile the findings into an official report. This report will detail the vulnerabilities discovered and highlight the top researchers, celebrating their contributions and expertise.\n\n\n\n\nThis event aims to be the largest crowdsourced security audit, enhancing the security of the entire Ethereum protocol codebase.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Collaborate with Immunefi?\n\n\n\n\nImmunefi is recognized for its experience in web3 security, managing a large community of security researchers. They have protected significant user funds across various projects and have a track record of identifying and mitigating security risks.\n\n\n\n\nImmunefi\u2019s Attackathons emphasize education and community involvement. Participants benefit from a structured environment that includes live explainers on Ethereum and security, as well as educational content from the Attackathon Academy. This collaboration aims to deepen the community\u2019s understanding of Ethereum\u2019s code and technology while contributing to its security.\n\n\n\n\nFuture Security Challenges\n\n\n\n\nThe EF\u2019s Protocol Security Research Team is committed to ongoing security improvements. We plan to host similar Ethereum protocol security challenges at every hard fork covering changes to the codebase. These events will be organized on different platforms, providing varied opportunities for the community to engage in securing the Ethereum protocol.\n\n\n\n"
