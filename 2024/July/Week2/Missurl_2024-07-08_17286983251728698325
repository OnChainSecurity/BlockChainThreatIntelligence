The Attackathon features a time-bound code review program by Immunefi, ensuring top-tier engagement from elite security researchers. Additionally, it includes a comprehensive community education program centered on Ethereum-related security and technology. \n \nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2015, Ethereum allows for programmable transactions and offers a secure and transparent environment for various applications beyond cryptocurrency, fostering innovation across finance, gaming, and supply chain management.\n \nSponsoring The Reward Pool\nImmunefi and the Ethereum Foundation invite the Ethereum community\u2014from ecosystem projects to developers\u2014to sponsor this enhancement of the protocol\u2019s security by contributing to the program\u2019s reward pool. Unique digital memorabilia will be available to reward their participation, along with specific benefits depending on the sponsorship tier. \n \nTo kick off the Sponsorship program, the Ethereum Foundation has seeded the reward pool with a contribution of $500,000. Starting today, Immunefi Ethereum community members can visit\u00a0\nimmunefi.com/sponsor-ethereum-attackathon/\n\u00a0to participate in the sponsorship program, and view the sponsor leaderboard as it is updated.\n \nThe sponsored pool will deposit directly into the Attackathon\u00a0\nvault\n\u00a0on Immunefi, a proprietary solution designed to transparently display the allocation of a program\u2019s funds and streamline the payment process between projects and security researchers. The sponsorship program will be closed and the final reward pool locked by 1st August 2024, after which further details of the Attackathon will be announced.\n \n\u201cAs part of our efforts to help further secure the Ethereum Protocol, we are excited to launch the first audit competition targeting the protocol itself, and can't wait to see what types of vulnerabilities it will surface!\" said Fredrik Svantes, Protocol Security Research Lead at the Ethereum Foundation.\n \nImmunefi operates the largest web3 security community with over 45,000 researchers. It protects over $190 billion in user funds for established projects like Chainlink, Wormhole, MakerDAO, TheGraph, Synthetix, Polygon, Optimism,\u00a0and more. Immunefi has paid out the most significant bug bounties in the software industry, amounting to over $100 million while saving over $25 billion in user funds. Currently, Immunefi offers over $161 million in bounty rewards. With Immunefi\u2019s researchers, 80% of projects find vulnerabilities missed by audits. \n \n\u201cEthereum is fundamentally transforming the world as we know it and will continue to do so, \u201d said Mitchell Amador, Founder and CEO of Immunefi. \u201cWe are incredibly proud to partner with the Ethereum Foundation and do our part to contribute to the vision of an open, more efficient, and decentralized future. By leveraging our collective security expertise and resources, we aim to ensure the integrity and security of the Ethereum network.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing together the world\u2019s top security community to safeguard one of the most significant blockchain technologies ever created,\u201d said Sajjad Rehman, VP of Revenue at Immunefi. \u201cThis commitment will not only bolster the security of the technology itself but also strengthen the trust and confidence of Ethereum\u2019s growing global user base.\u201d\n \nEthereum Security Education\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Attackathon will include a comprehensive educational component, providing dedicated resources such as Ethereum technology and security explainers and a dedicated guide on the Attackathon. These resources aim to enhance accessibility for the broader security researcher community and deepen their engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem. \n \nAbout Immunefi\nImmunefi\n\u00a0is the largest crowdsourced security platform for web3.
