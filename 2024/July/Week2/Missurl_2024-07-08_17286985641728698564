The \u201cAttackathon\u201d will last four weeks, during which participants will actively search for flaws in Ethereum\u2019s protocol code. Only impactful and rule-compliant reports will receive rewards.\n\n\nThe event kicks off with a technical walkthrough of the blockchain\u2019s code, helping participants identify and understand potential vulnerabilities. After the event, the bug bounty platform Immunefi will compile a report detailing the discovered vulnerabilities.\n\n\nEPS has contributed $500,000 to the prize pool and is seeking sponsors to raise an additional $1.5 million by August 1, when more details will be shared. The EPS team plans to host similar hackathons for every hard fork to cover changes to the codebase.\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming \u201cPectra\u201d hard fork, expected to go live late this year or early next, combines the \u201cPrague\u201d and \u201cElectra\u201d upgrades. Key updates include a \u201csocial recovery\u201d feature that could eliminate the need for the traditional 24-word private wallet key, giving wallets smart contract-like features.\n\n\nIn the tech world, hackathons are commonplace, with the crypto industry hosting frequent events, alongside ongoing bug bounties incentivizing hackers to disclose exploits rather than exploit them maliciously, with LayerZero offering the highest reward of $15 million on Immunefi\u2019s site.\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201cAttackathon\u201d is set to boost the blockchain\u2019s security by leveraging the expertise of the global security research community.\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: \nEthereum Developers Unveils EIP-7732 Designed for Speed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
