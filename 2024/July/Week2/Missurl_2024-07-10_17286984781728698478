Our goal is to raise over $2 million for the reward pool, [and] the EF has seeded the pool with an initial $500,000.\u201d\n\n\nPer Ethereum Foundation, the sponsorship program offering entities and individuals the opportunity to contribute to the Attackathon\u2019s reward pool will close on August 1st.\n\n\n\u201cAfter the Attackathon, Immunefi will evaluate and compile the findings into an official report. This report will detail the vulnerabilities discovered and highlight the top researchers, celebrating their contributions and expertise.\u201d\n\n\nImmunefi \nsays\n that the sponsors will get \u201cNFTs (non-fungible tokens) recognizing their contribution, and their name will be immortalized on our Sponsorship Leaderboard.\u201d\n\n\nOn the potential benefits for the participants, Immunefi says,\n\n\n\u201cThe Attackathon will showcase Immunefi\u2019s elite security researcher community, competing to secure the protocol in a time-boxed audit competition with the potential to earn massive rewards, reputation, and glory. Top-performing whitehats will have their skills recognized in front of the entire Ethereum community.\n\n\nIt will also come packed with a comprehensive education program to upskill and broaden the security researcher community around the Ethereum protocol.\u201d\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 \nSubscribe\n to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\n\n\n\nCheck \nPrice Action\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on \nX\n, \nFacebook\n and \nTelegram\n\n\n\n\nSurf \nThe Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
