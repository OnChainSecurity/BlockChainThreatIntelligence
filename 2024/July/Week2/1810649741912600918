        "original_content": "Attended an insightful talk at [#EthCC] by\n\n[@calilyliu](/calilyliu)\n\nfrom\n\n[@SolanaFndn](/SolanaFndn)\n\nabout why PayFi, programmable money, can only scale on Solana. We are very\noptimistic about PayFi thriving on Solana.\n? Solana provides users\nwith an excellent experience and has high performance for developers. We have\nbeen following Solana's development and supporting it through tools, knowledge\nsharing, and other means. ?\nOur product family has fully supported Solana. In March, our crypto tracking\nand investigation platform MetaSleuth\n\n[@MetaSleuth](/MetaSleuth)\n\nsupported Solana. It adopted a unique design that maps multiple token\naddresses to a single wallet address, providing clear and concise fund flows\ntailored to Solana's token account mechanism.\n?\ufe0f Learn more at:\n[https://blocksec.com/blog/best-solana-transaction-visualization-\ntool\u2026](https://t.co/9PzVLrslld) In May, our blockchain explorer extension\nMetaSuites\n\n[@MetaDockTeam](/MetaDockTeam)\n\nadded support for major Solana scans (including Solana Explorer,\n[#Solscan], and SolanaFM). This support\nallows users to view fund flow diagrams and automatically synchronize custom\naddress labels across multiple platforms. Learn more at:\n[https://blocksec.com/blog/meta-suites-5-0-extends-full-support-to-solana-\nscans\u2026](https://t.co/MtGwW8CU2X) In June, our transaction visualization tool\nPhalcon Explorer's\n\n[@Phalcon_xyz](/Phalcon_xyz)\n\nsupport for Solana brought significant convenience to Solana users and\ndevelopers. Users can easily understand complex transactions through clearer\naccount relationships, MEV transaction identification, and access to a vast\ndatabase of address labels. Developers benefit from more accurate function\ncall levels and efficient information presentation, making smart contract\ndebugging and analysis more intuitive and effective. Learn more at:\n[https://blocksec.com/blog/meta-suites-5-0-extends-full-support-to-solana-\nscans\u2026](https://t.co/MtGwW8CU2X) We have also published many educational\nseries articles about Solana. For example, the \"Solana Simplified\" series,\nincludes articles on Solana's basic concepts, tutorials on writing Solana\nsmart contracts, and guides for analyzing Solana transactions. The goal is to\nhelp readers understand the Solana ecosystem and master essential skills for\ndeveloping projects and conducting transactions on Solana. Learn more at:\n[https://blocksec.com/blog?keywords=solana%20simplified\u2026](https://t.co/cILXNtRhIF)\nIn the \"Secure the Solana Ecosystem\" series, we delve into various aspects of\nsecurity on the Solana blockchain. Starting with foundational concepts, the\nseries progresses through more nuanced topics such as cross-program\ninteractions, account validations, and handling of complex features like\nmulti-signature mechanisms and type safety. Each article is designed to build\nupon the last, providing developers with a comprehensive understanding of how\nto enhance security and efficiency when working with Solana.\n?\ufe0f Learn more at:\n[https://blocksec.com/blog?series=Secure%20the%20Solana%20Ecosystem\u2026](https://t.co/9PT0xCbxIR)\nWe will continue to contribute more useful tools and support to the Solana\necosystem and believe that Solana will bring more innovations to benefit\nusers. ?\n[#Solana]\n[#PayFi]\n[#Web3]"
