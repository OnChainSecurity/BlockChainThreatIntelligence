        "original_content": "\nConstellation Network, a decentralised network that enables anyone to build the future of Web3 with fast and feeless transactions, has opened its doors to developers ready to build on Hypergraph, the secure ledger technology behind Constellation.\nDeveloped over years under US Department of Defense contracts, this breakthrough platform is now available for public use.\nAs CoinTelegraph reported, Constellation is currently organising the Global Metagraph Hackathon, a free virtual event with $100,000 in DAG (Constellation cryptocurrency) as prizes. It will take place from July 15 to September 9, 2024. The competitive categories centre on metagraph development and the various tools employed directly within associated chains. The grand prize? Could it be the best Metagraph of them all? There\u2019s a cool $25,000 bounty for the winning submission.\nBut what exactly is a metagraph? It\u2019s Constellation\u2019s application layer technology that operates on top of their Hypergraph global consensus layer. Think of it as a versatile platform that can host any type of decentralised application (dApp) network or even traditional Web2 networks, each with its own unique business logic. Interestingly, other blockchains can also function as metagraphs within Constellation\u2019s ecosystem.\nBen Jorgensen, CEO of Constellation Network, said: \"Constellation\u2019s Hypergraph is the blockchain of blockchains. We believe the future of Web3 and blockchain technology lies in interoperability and collaboration across different chains and communities.\"\nJorgensen highlights the potential of Hypergraph to unite various emerging technologies. \"This technology can connect them all, ensure interoperability, and provide an underlying infrastructure to secure networks and validate data flows,\" he said.\nThe hackathon has attracted some big names as partners. Panasonic, IBM, SIMBA Chain, C14 cryptocurrency on-ramping service, and the Stardust Collective are all on board. Also joining is the National DigiFoundry, led by members from the US National Science Foundation, US Space Force, and US Department of Treasury.\nWhat sets Constellation\u2019s Hypergraph apart? It\u2019s a fast, feeless network built on DAG-based infrastructure and microservices. This design creates a flexible digital transfer layer with an adaptable application network overlay (the metagraph). The result? Enhanced interoperability and composability across both Web3 and traditional Web2 networks.\nFor businesses and governments looking to adopt blockchain technology, Constellation offers crucial features: network security, data validation, scalability, and simplified onboarding.\n\u2018Interoperability\u2019 is more than just a buzzword in the Web3 world. Consider a smart city where multiple IoT networks communicate and share data. Each network could have its own metagraph, all interconnected through the underlying Hypergraph.\nThe big draw, not surprisingly, is how flexible that makes Constellation\u2019s metagraphs. They allow you to work with any data type, directly connect with external data sources, and use your existing Scala or Java libraries. It allows developers to have their own built-in validation and consensus logic in the networks. Moreover, these metagraphs can scale very quickly with our multilayered microservice architecture, which is designed for massive-scale applications.\nOver the coming years, as blockchain technology matures, Constellation\u2019s Hypergraph and metagraph technologies provide a vision of how diverse networks and technologies can become interoperable, disrupting decentralised systems and the evolution of data management.\nSee also: North Korean hackers transfer stolen crypto to wallet of Asian payment firm\nWant to learn about the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence?
