Investigating reports of unusual activity, the project holding $40 million in crypto assets shut activity down swiftly.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Base\u2019s surging profits have been fueled by a rapid increase in total value locked (TVL), according to L2BEAT, in turn driven by Ethereum\u2019s implementation of EIP-4844 and proto-danksharding via the anticipated Dencun upgrade in March. According...\n\nNews\nDeFi\n3 min read\nNathan Reiff\nJun 5, 2024\nA Rho Market dashboard indicated at the time that a total of $1.1 million and $2.3 million worth of the stablecoins Tether and USDC had been \"borrowed\" on the platform in amounts exceeding their listed supply. The same could be said of wstETH, a wrapped version of Lido-staked Ethereum, of which $6 million had been borrowed.\n\nOn Twitter, Scroll instructed users to \"temporarily revoke all approvals,\" preventing decentralized applications from accessing users\u2019 funds. Before that, the account stated that Scroll had temporarily delayed the network\u2019s finalization, suggesting that transactions on the network would take extra time to process.\n\nAccording to the entity that swiped users\u2019 funds, price oracles that communicate crypto prices to Rho Markets\u2019 protocol were improperly implemented. The apparent error enabled a bot to order transactions in a profitable way.\n\nAD\nThe Gala token.

Approximately 5,913 ETH, or about $22 million, was sent back from the attacker\u2019s wallet to a Gala wallet on Tuesday morning, representing the funds earned from selling 600 million GALA tokens on decentralized exchange Uniswap shortly after Monday\u2019s explo...\n\nNews\nCoins\n3 min read\nAndrew Hayward\nMay 22, 2024\nAn hour after the entity put forth its on-chain demands, around $7.6 million worth of Ethereum linked to the exploit was transferred to a different wallet.\n\nScroll nor Rho Markets immediately responded to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nRho Markets wrote in the aftermath that it would take \"three meticulously planned steps\": assessing which accounts were supplying funds when its oracle broke, replenishing funds in the affected areas, and reinstating its normal lending functions.\n\n\"Rest assured, our team is diligently executing these steps to reinstate normalcy,\" the project added, emphasizing its goal to \"safeguard the interests of our valued users.\"\n\n\nThe crypto sleuth ZachXBT had written on Twitter that \"there\u2019s a good probability\" the funds would get recovered because the entity responsible for Friday\u2019s exploit has \"a ton of exposure to centralized exchanges.\" As that would make it easier for law enforcement to identify the would-be attacker, he said the entity was likely taking an ethical approach.\n\nWhile $7.6 million is a significant sum, it\u2019s still a small slice of the overall assets locked within decentralized applications on Scroll, which have swelled to around $640 million from $174 million a month ago, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nThe scaling solution for Ethereum launched its public mainnet last October. Several months before, Scroll\u2019s creators raised $50 million in an undisclosed funding round led by Polychain Capital, according to CryptoRank.\n\nAD\nFriday wasn\u2019t the first time an Ethereum scaling network has been impacted amid concerns over users\u2019 lost crypto. Last month, Linea froze all transactions on its network to prevent attackers from stealing more crypto from the decentralized exchange Velcore. It worked."
