        "original_content": "Optimistic rollups are layer 2 (L2) protocols designed to extend the throughput of Ethereum's base layer. They reduce computation on the main Ethereum chain by processing transactions off-chain, offering significant improvements in processing speeds. Unlike other scaling solutions, such as sidechains, optimistic rollups derive security from Mainnet by publishing transaction results on-chain, or plasma chains, which also verify transactions on Ethereum with fraud proofs, but store transaction data elsewhere.\n\nAs computation is the slow, expensive part of using Ethereum, optimistic rollups can offer up to 10-100x improvements in scalability. Optimistic rollups also write transactions to Ethereum as calldata or in blobs, reducing gas costs for users.What is an optimistic rollup?\nAn optimistic rollup is an approach to scaling Ethereum that involves moving computation and state storage off-chain. Optimistic rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum, but post transaction data to Mainnet as calldata or in blobs.\n\nOptimistic rollup operators bundle multiple off-chain transactions together in large batches before submitting to Ethereum. This approach enables spreading fixed costs across multiple transactions in each batch, reducing fees for end-users. Optimistic rollups also use compression techniques to reduce the amount of data posted on Ethereum.\n\nOptimistic rollups are considered \"optimistic\" because they assume off-chain transactions are valid and don't publish proofs of validity for transaction batches posted on-chain. This separates optimistic rollups from zero-knowledge rollups that publish cryptographic proofs of validity for off-chain transactions.\n\nOptimistic rollups instead rely on a fraud-proving scheme to detect cases where transactions are not calculated correctly. After a rollup batch is submitted on Ethereum, there's a time window (called a challenge period) during which anyone can challenge the results of a rollup transaction by computing a fraud proof.\n\nIf the fraud proof succeeds, the rollup protocol re-executes the transaction(s) and updates the rollup's state accordingly. The other effect of a successful fraud proof is that the sequencer responsible for including the incorrectly executed transaction in a block receives a penalty.\n\nIf the rollup batch remains unchallenged (i.e., all transactions are correctly executed) after the challenge period elapses, it is deemed valid and accepted on Ethereum. Others can continue to build on an unconfirmed rollup block, but with a caveat: transaction results will be reversed if based on an incorrectly executed transaction published previously.\n\nHow do optimistic rollups interact with Ethereum?\nOptimistic rollups are off-chain scaling solutions built to operate on top of Ethereum. Each optimistic rollup is managed by a set of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. Optimistic rollups process transactions off the main Ethereum chain, but post off-chain transactions (in batches) to an on-chain rollup contract. Like the Ethereum blockchain, this transaction record is immutable and forms the \"optimistic rollup chain.\"\n\nThe architecture of an optimistic rollup comprises the following parts:\n\nOn-chain contracts: The optimistic rollups's operation is controlled by smart contracts running on Ethereum. This includes contracts that store rollup blocks, monitor state updates on the rollup, and track user deposits. In this sense, Ethereum serves as the base layer or \"layer 1\" for optimistic rollups.\n\nOff-chain virtual machine (VM): Although contracts managing the optimistic rollup protocol run on Ethereum, the rollup protocol performs computation and state storage on another virtual machine separate from the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The off-chain VM is where applications live and state changes are executed; it serves as the upper layer or \"layer 2\" for an optimistic rollup.\n\nAs optimistic rollups are designed to run programs either written or compiled for the EVM, the off-chain VM incorporates many EVM design specs. Additionally, fraud proofs computed on-chain allows the Ethereum network to enforce the validity of state changes computed in the off-chain VM.\n\nOptimistic rollups are described as 'hybrid scaling solutions' because, while they exist as separate protocols, their security properties are derived from Ethereum. Among other things, Ethereum guarantees the correctness of a rollup\u2019s off-chain computation and the availability of data behind the computation. This makes optimistic rollups more secure than pure off-chain scaling protocols (e.g., sidechains) that do not rely on Ethereum for security.\n\nOptimistic rollups rely on the main Ethereum protocol for the following:\n\nData availability\nAs mentioned, optimistic rollups post transaction data to Ethereum as calldata or blobs. Since the rollup chain's execution is based on submitted transactions, anyone can use this information-anchored on Ethereum\u2019s base layer-to execute the rollup\u2019s state and verify the correctness of state transitions.\n\nData availability is critical because without access to state data, challengers cannot construct fraud proofs to dispute invalid rollup operations. With Ethereum providing data availability, the risk of rollup operators getting away with malicious acts (e.g., submitting invalid blocks) is reduced."
