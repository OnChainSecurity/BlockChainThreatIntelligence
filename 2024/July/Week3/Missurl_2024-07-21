This Blockchain Tutorial covers all basic to advanced topics of blockchain like cryptography, Blockchain Algorithms, Blockchain Architecture, Blockchain Security, Smart Contracts, etc.Table of Content\n\nWhat is Blockchain?\nWhy Do We Use Blockchain?\nIntroduction to Blockchain Technology\nCryptography\nConsensus Algorithms\nBlockchain Architecture\nBlockchain and Cryptocurrency\nSmart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps)\nBlockchain Security\nBlockchain Applications\nBlockchain Implementation\nMiscellaneous\nInterview Questions\nWhat is Blockchain?\nA Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is secure, immutable, and decentralized. It consists of a chain of blocks and each block contains a secure group of transactions of money, bitcoins, contracts, property, etc. without any need for third-party middle-man such as central authorities, banks, government, etc. Transactions are verified by a network of computers. Once a block of information is created in the chain, it can\u2019t be changed or deleted. This makes the blockchain very secure and trustworthy. It is a software protocol, it never runs without the internet.\n\nA Blockchain is a chain of blocks that contains information about transactions. On completion of a transaction, it will go to the blockchain\u2019s permanent database. It is mainly used for secure transactions without any third-party involvement in between. To visualize blocks, transactions, and blockchain network metrics, you can use blockchain explorer.\n\nWhy Do We Use Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a distributed digital ledger of transactions. It changes the whole concept of the transaction now we don\u2019t have any need for centralized authorities to verify our transactions, blockchain makes it decentralized and secure. The security is maintained by cryptographic processes performed by p2p users, through the process called Data mining Here are some important features given below:Secure\nTransparent\nTamper-proof\nPeer-to-peer transaction\nRecent Articles on Blockchain\nIntroduction to Blockchain Technology\nIntroduction to Blockchain Technology\nHistory of Blockchain\nFeatures of Blockchain\nImportant Blockchain Terminologies\nDifferent Versions of Blockchain \nTypes of Blockchain\nPublic Blockchain\nPrivate Blockchain\nHybrid Blockchain\nConsortium Blockchain\nApplications of Blockchain\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Blockchain \nBenefits of Blockchain Technology\nHow Does the Blockchain Work?\nNeed of Blockchain\nPeer-to-Peer Network\nWhat is Decentralization?\nWhat is Ledger?\nWhat is Blockchain Distributed Ledger?\nDifference between Centralized and Distributed Ledgers\nDifference between Public and Private LedgersCryptography\nCryptography and its Types\nCryptography in Blockchain\nBlockchain Hash Function\nBlockchain -
