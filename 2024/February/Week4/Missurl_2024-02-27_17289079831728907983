On Tuesday, XRP price climbed to a high of $0.56. The $0.55 level was a key resistance for XRP for over a month.\u00a0\n\n\nThe altcoin is rallying towards its $0.60 target. In its uptrend, XRP price faces resistance at the 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels of the altcoin\u2019s decline from its 2024 peak.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence/ Divergence (MACD) indicator and Awesome Oscillator (AO) support XRP price gains and signal that the uptrend is intact.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\u00a0\n\n\nA daily \ncandlestick\n close below the $0.54 level could invalidate the bullish thesis and the altcoin could find support at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.52.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Interest, funding rate FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
