Specifically, a wallet associated with the attacker moved $826,500 worth of Dai stablecoin to another wallet.\n\nThe KyberSwap hack, a major incident in 2023, saw DEX lose nearly $49 million in digital assets. On Nov. 23, KyberSwap disclosed the breach, urging users to withdraw their funds. The hacker left a message indicating a willingness to negotiate once he rested.\n\nKyberSwap proposed a $4.6 million bounty for 90% of the stolen funds\u2019 return. After the hacker\u2019s unexpected move, they demanded complete control over KyberSwap and its assets, along with temporary ownership of KyberDAO and all related documents, by December 10, 2023, under threat of consequences. \n\nThe aftermath also led to significant internal repercussions, with KyberSwap having to downsize its workforce by fifty percent just a month after the security breach.\n\nFollow The Crypto Times on Google News to Stay Updated!
