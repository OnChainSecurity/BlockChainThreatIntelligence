Amidst this backdrop, EOS has once again demonstrated its commitment to pioneering robust security solutions with the latest achievement of Recover+ (R+), a cutting-edge cybersecurity portal and rapid incident response program. Designed to safeguard EOS DeFi projects and their users, R+ has recently marked a significant milestone in its journey to ensure the integrity and safety of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nBuilding on a successful legacy, R+ has broken new ground by successfully intervening in an incident involving the EOS EVM, showcasing expanded capabilities beyond EOS Native, unprecedented in the industry. This remarkable recovery operation not only secured nearly 2 million EOS for its rightful owners but it also establishes R+ as the first program of its kind to extend its protective measures to EOS EVM projects.\n\nFrom Breach to Breakthrough: The PayCash Recovery on EOS EVM\nThe EOS Recover+ (R+) team confronted a challenging security breach that tested the limits of their capabilities and the blockchain\u2019s infrastructure. The saga began on May 6, 2023, when the R+ team detected a hack targeting PayCash, a project operating within the EOS ecosystem. Efforts to establish communication with the PayCash team were immediately set into motion, but before contact was established the situation escalated as the hacker shifted the stolen funds to the EOS EVM, a domain where-at that time-no established tools or protocols existed to handle such incidents.\n\nThe absence of an audit for PayCash compounded the complexity of the situation, prompting months of collaboration between the R+ team, EOS EVM engineers, and the PayCash team to devise a viable recovery solution. The breakthrough came shortly after the release of EOS EVM v0.5.2 in September which introduced several key administrative actions tailored to address critical security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn preparation for recovery, on January 25th, the R+ team showcased their proposed solution on the Jungle Testnet, seeking input and support from key EOS engineers including Denis Carrier of EOS Nation and Bohdan of CryptoLions, and initiating broader discussions with EOS Block Producers (BPs) to lay the groundwork for the forthcoming proposal.\n\nOn February 19th, a day prior to the proposal submission, EOS BPs were briefed on the proposed technical solution aimed at rectifying the PayCash hack. This preemptive measure was designed to facilitate a thorough verification process, allowing BPs to pose questions and understand the proposal\u2019s intricacies.\n\nOn February 21st, the R+ team submitted a Multi-Signature (MSIG) proposal to address the PayCash hack, securing approval from 15 out of 21 Block Producers (BPs). However, this initial proposal failed to execute due to deferred transactions no longer being processed on EOS Mainnet, prompting an immediate and focused response from Francis, the R+ project lead, alongside EOS engineers. They quickly identified and addressed the issue, streamlining their approach for a second submission.\n\nBy February 22nd, with the insights gained and adjustments made, a revised proposal was put forward. This time, it successfully navigated the technical challenges and is endorsed by eosio.evm@active permission. These actions initiated the recovery of nearly 2 million EOS that were transferred to eos.recover from the more than 6,000 hacker controlled accounts. This was a truly monumental demonstration of the EOS ecosystem\u2019s resilience and the newfound reach of the R+ program in securing assets on the EOS EVM against sophisticated threats.\n\nOn February 26th, PayCash published this open letter to the community:\n\nDear crypto community,\n\nOn Feb 22, 2024, the Recover+ team successfully froze 2 million EOS of compromised funds on EOS EVM and is already in the progress of a final recovery. \n\nThe PayCash team expresses our deepest gratitude to the Recover+ team for their continued support and expertise in ensuring the restoration of justice. This not only highlights the effectiveness of the Recover+ initiative, but also shows how reliable and advanced the EOS ecosystem is. \n\nAs a sign of our appreciation and commitment to creating a more secure blockchain environment, we commit to donate 5% of all recovered funds to further support and develop the Recover+ project. This gesture reflects our contribution to support ongoing efforts to strengthen security measures and protect the EOS community from possible threats, as well as the full popularization of the EOS blockchain. \n\nWith sincere thanks, \n\nThe PayCash Development Team\nThis episode not only underscores the technical agility and collaborative spirit within the EOS community but also marks a significant milestone in blockchain history. The successful recovery operation highlights the evolving capability of the EOS infrastructure to respond to complex security challenges, particularly within the EVM framework.\n\nThe next steps involve continued engagement with the PayCash community and the formulation of a subsequent proposal to ensure the repatriation of the recovered funds to their rightful owners. This incident serves as a testament to the efficacy of R+ and its critical role in safeguarding the EOS ecosystem against sophisticated threats, thereby enhancing the security and trustworthiness of blockchain technology.\n\nThe PayCash Recovery Operation TLDR;\nMay 6, 2023: R+ team detects a security breach targeting the PayCash project on EOS.\nPost-Detection: Efforts to contact the PayCash team begin as the hacker moves funds to EOS EVM, a domain lacking tools for such incidents.\nFollowing Months: Collaborative efforts between the R+ team, EOS EVM engineers, and PayCash team to develop a recovery solution.\nSeptember: Introduction of EOS EVM v0.5.2, bringing administrative actions to address security vulnerabilities.\nJanuary 25: Proposed recovery solution showcased on the Jungle testnet, engaging EOS Engineers and EOS BPs for feedback.\nFebruary 19: EOS BPs briefed on the recovery proposal and engaged in lengthy Q&A with the R+ team, facilitating a thorough verification process.\nFebruary 21: Initial proposal submitted and approved by 15/21 BPs but failed to execute due to deferred transactions.\nFebruary 22: Francis, the R+ project lead, and EOS Engineers identify a resolution to the issue, leading to a revised proposal. This proposal, overcoming the initial setbacks, was endorsed by eosio.evm@active permission and successfully recovered nearly 2 million EOS from over 6,000 accounts to eos.recover.\n\"This action exemplifies a solid framework for future non-mainnet governance across EOS, notably for EOS EVM and the anticipated BTCL2. Although no system is perfect, we are committed to refining ours case by case.
