Rug pulls were also the most common type of crypto attack last year, targeting millions of victims across the globe. Thus, it is essential to learn more about crypto rug pull scams to mitigate the risk in 2024.What is a crypto rug pull scam?\nIn a rug pull scam, a fraudulent developer or promoter launches and hypes a cryptocurrency project to attract investment. Further, when the project gains value, the scammer abandons it, leaving investors with a worthless asset. A rug pull begins with the creation and listing of a new cryptocurrency token which is often paired with a coin from a leading platform, such as Ethereum. Fraudsters then employ marketing tactics using social media and launch a buzzing promotional campaign across social media and other channels to bait a community of investors.\nThese scams often promise hefty returns or assign membership, like in a Ponzi scheme. Once the operation gains enough traction, the token\u2019s value soars. As the price peaks, the core development team dumps its share of the tokens, crashing their value and leaving the investors with a worthless asset. While this is an example of a type of soft rug pull, in a hard rug pull, developers include malicious exploits in a project\u2019s code to investors or prevent them from selling tokens.The biggest crypto rug pull scams of 2023\nFintoch: $31.6 million\n\nIn May 2023, a crypto project called Fintoch stole nearly $32 million from investors in a rug pull scam.

It is important to realize that not every new cryptocurrency or NFT will be the next big thing. Thus, crypto investors are advised to look through the hype and not take anything at its face value, especially, if it\u2019s a new project.\n\nDo your research\nInvestors, especially beginners should gather as much information about a project as possible before investing. They should research the developers\u2019 backgrounds, including past projects and experience, and look into the project specs. Further, if the project has a white paper, it is best to go through it.Always read disclosures\nIn case the investment opportunity comes with disclosures, investors are advised to always read them. This may safeguard them from potentially falling for false promises as the SEC requires crypto companies to provide necessary information to investors and potential investors. In case a digital doesn\u2019t have a disclosure, it may be a scam or dubious."
