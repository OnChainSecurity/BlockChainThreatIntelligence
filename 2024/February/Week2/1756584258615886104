And include various flavours of wrapped\nETH, a few stablecoins, MATIC, RLB, MKR. All kinds of stuff from 31st Jan to\n2nd Feb. And what do we find on 2nd Feb?\n\n[@realScamSniffer](/realScamSniffer)\n\nflagging the address.\n[https://x.com/realscamsniffe/realScamSniffer/status/1753425680065585207\u2026](/realScamSniffer/status/1753425680065585207)\nDoes that work? The flows stopped on the 2nd and it took a week for Tether to\nblacklist them. All the work here was done off-chain via social processes. The\nonly thing even vaguely-formalized (Tether blacklisting) was late and it would\nappear pretty irrelevant. Is that the goal?"
