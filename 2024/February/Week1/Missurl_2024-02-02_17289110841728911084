That means Ronin addresses \u2013 including YOUR address \u2013 will start with \n0x\n instead of \nronin:.\nThis change is 100% aesthetic and won\u2019t affect your funds or collectibles. There is no action required. We wanted to give you a heads up because you may wonder why Ronin addresses start to look different. Sky Mavis apps will continue to support the \nronin:\n prefix on the back end for now.\nToday, we\u2019re rolling out this change to Mavis and Ronin apps. These include Mavis Store, App.Axie, the Ronin Wallet, Mavis Market, and other dApps in the Ronin ecosystem. Throughout February, we\u2019ll roll it out to more parts of the Ronin ecosystem.\nWe\u2019d like to let Ronin users know that we\u2019ve begun updating Ronin address prefixes from \nronin: \nto \n0x\n. Here\u2019s what that means for your user experience on Ronin:\nWant to put the Ronin back in your Ronin address? Get an RNS name! These are human-readable shorthands that replace 42-character addresses with text of your choice ending in .ron.\nWhat are Ronin Address Prefixes?\nEvery blockchain address has a prefix followed by a long string of characters. In general, all addresses on the same blockchain will have the \nsame\n prefix but \ndifferent\n characters afterwards. In the example above, you\u2019ll see an address with an \n0x\n prefix.\nToday, we\u2019ve begun changing Ronin address prefixes from \nronin:\n to \n0x.\n That means all Ronin addresses will soon start with an \n0x\n instead of \nronin:\n. This is an aesthetic change that won\u2019t affect your funds or collectibles. However, we wanted to give you a heads up because it means every Ronin address will now look different.\u00a0\n\nNote that an Ethereum address beginning with 0x is still a different address than a Ronin address beginning with 0x.\nWhere and When You\u2019ll See New Address Prefixes\nToday, we\u2019re rolling out the \n0x \nprefix to Mavis and Ronin apps. These include Mavis Store, App.Axie, the Ronin Wallet, Mavis Market, and other dApps in the Ronin ecosystem. Throughout February, we\u2019ll roll it out to more parts of the Ronin ecosystem. We\u2019re working with our ecosystem partners to ensure they implement the update in February as well.\u00a0\nThis change will be gradual, so you\u2019ll still see some addresses with \nronin:\n prefixes and others with \n0x\n prefixes until the migration is complete. It\u2019s also a 100% aesthetic change: the prefix of an address on Ronin has no impact on funds, collectibles, or smart contract function. There\u2019s also no action required by users.\nFinal Thoughts about the ronin: Prefix \u2013 a Relic of the Great Migration\nWe launched Ronin in 2021 because Ethereum and Loom Network were too slow and expensive to meet the needs of Axie Infinity players. We started by migrating land plots and axies onto Ronin, but soon ran into a problem: Axie Infinity players were confusing their Ethereum addresses with their Ronin addresses, which meant some players sent funds were to the wrong place! So, we introduced the \nronin:\n prefix to separate the two types of addresses. Problem solved.\nToday, we\u2019re going \nback\n to the original address prefix \u2013\n 0x\n. We\u2019re doing this because users have gotten used to the difference between Ronin and Ethereum. It also reinforces our Ethereum alignment. The Ronin Wallet\u2019s multi-chain support will also make it easier for Ethereans to onboard onto Ronin, and \n0x\n will be more familiar to them."
