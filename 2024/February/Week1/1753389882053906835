        "original_content": "As a security firm in Web3, our focus is on safeguarding protocols from\nmalicious actors. The industry has quite matured over the last couple of\nyears. The last bull market pushed the space mainstream with millions of new\nusers joining the revolution. The volume of projects has increased, leading to\na corresponding rise in competition. Not to mention the vast amounts of\nsecurity researchers and security companies that entered and continue to do so\nthroughout the last year or two. A significant portion of the projects are\nfocused on products and services, most of which have no value differentiators\namong each other. The focus still remains on safeguarding their codebases and\nprotecting user funds. This is more of an outside-in approach, however. Yet,\nthere is a significant gap in an area where the focus is still very thin - the\nsecurity of users outside the protocol\u2019s reach. Safeguarding user wallets,\nrespectively their funds. The same funds that are most needed for liquidity\nacross smart contracts. Our space has gained the reputation of being scammy,\nnot because of its nature, but because of its bad actors. The question is: In\nthis upcoming bull market, should Web3 be able to attract and more importantly\nsustain the new wave of users? The core of our space is its community, the\nliving and breathing fuel of the ecosystem. We\u2019re firm believers that the\nfocus should shift towards wallet security with automated risk triggers\nagainst drainers stepping on our doorway. The project that will focus on\nproviding the tools and infra to tackle it, will most probably take all the\novations in achieving the overarching objective of Web3 - its security This is\nan urge within our security field to innovate, instead of rigidly focusing on\ncodebase auditing. We need a more holistic approach. It's the only driver for\ninnovation and development within the space \\- Shieldify\u2019s Team"
