PlayDapp tried to recover the funds by offering a $1 million white hat reward but the hackers chose to launder the money, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.\u00a0\n\n\nThe automated crypto exchange FixedFloat comes in second with $25.85 million in losses.\n\n\nJeff \u201cJihoz\u201d Zirlin, the founder of the blockchain-based game Axie Infinity (\nAXS\n) and gaming-centric Ethereum (\nETH\n) sidechain Ronin (\nRON\n), takes the third spot. \nHe \nsays\n the breach \u2013 which drained $9.7 million worth of crypto assets from his wallets \u2013 only affected his personal accounts.\n\n\n\u201cTwo of my addresses have been compromised. The attack is limited to my personal accounts, and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain. \n\n\nAdditionally, the leaked keys have nothing to do with Sky Mavis operations. I want to assure everyone that we have strict security measures in place for all chain-related activities.\u201d\n\n\nMeanwhile, layer-1 blockchain Shido (\nSHIDO\n) and stablecoin protocol Seneca (\nSEN\n) suffered losses of $7.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively.\n\n\nPeckShield says only a small percentage of the stolen assets were recovered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHackers stole ~$360.83 million across over 21 attacks in February 2024, marking a month-on-month increase of 97.6% compared to January 2024. Additionally, ~1.8% of the stolen funds have been returned, totaling ~$6.7 million.\u201d\n\n\nSource: PeckShield/X\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 \nSubscribe\n to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\n\nCheck \nPrice Action\n\n\nFollow us on \nX\n, \nFacebook\n and \nTelegram\n\n\nSurf \nThe Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
