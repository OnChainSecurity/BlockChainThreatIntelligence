        "original_content": "Alright, buckle up folks. You're in for a ride. I would like to present, in\ncollaboration with\n\n[@0xFantasy](/0xFantasy)\n\n; who, like myself, is not entirely sure if he's finally cracked or if we\nmight actually be on to something here, I would like to present - A Theory!!\nLet's go back to Nov 11, 2022. That day, a group of sim swappers went into a\nmobile phone store in Texas and swapped a phone, according to court papers\nreleased a few days ago. That phone belonged to an employee of an unnamed\ncompany, listed as \"Company 1\" in the docs I'll link later. These sim swappers\nstole $400 million bucks from that company via the access gained from that\nsingle employee's account, and used that swapped phone to access 'virtual\ncurrency accounts' of the company and steal the crypto they contained. Okay,\nwith me so far? Right, let's move to the next bit (this is where Fantasy and I\nboth started saying \"NO EFFING WAY\") You wanna know what else happened on the\nsame day? Specifically, the night of November 11, 2022? I'll give you a hint -\nit involved a company we all know VERY WELL, which we'll never ever forget...\nFTX. Yep. FTX was hacked for \"over 400 million\" the night that it all went\ndown. It ended up being roughly 477 million, but all the news reports round it\ndown. Lots of people say it was an inside job, sure; but the longer it's been,\nthe more likely it is that it was just a ridiculously wild coincidence, but\nstill a legit hack nonetheless.\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFOmH1yXoAA1TFB?format=png&name=360x360)](/Plumferno/status/1752929425459470479/photo/1)\n\nThe hackers blew through an insane amount of the stolen funds just trying to\nswap it all as fast as they possibly could, on as many exchanges as possible\nand in the most haphazard manner imaginable. It was almost like they weren't\nparticularly experienced or coordinated moving that sort of money, opposite of\nwhat we've seen from say, Lazarus, for example. Most of the other large hacks\n& exploits which have taken place over the years have been considerably less\nchaotic in their execution. Now, think to yourself - what exchange could\nPOSSIBLY be dumb enough to have left that much money on a hot wallet (or a\nbunch of them?), accessible via a single sim-swapped phone? FTX, probably.\n......yeah.? SO, let's\nrecap! 1) What 2) Indictment filed Jan 24th stating this case against sim\nswappers who stole \"over 400 million\" on Nov 11th 2022, from \"Company 1\";\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/sim-swapping-ring-stole-400m-in-\ncrypto-from-a-us-company-officials-allege/\u2026](https://t.co/caguXxi4RN) 3) FTX\nwas hacked by unknown parties on Nov 11, 2022, for \"over 400 million; hackers\nnever identified; 4) On page 18 in the court papers for the sim swappers, it's\nstated that they've been ordered to pay everyone back in full;\n[https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/USA-v-Powell-Order-on-\nMotion-for-Miscellaneous-Relief-1-25-2024.pdf\u2026](https://t.co/9wS3eEyLgW) 5)\nFTX announced today that they're scrapping plans to restart the exchange, but\nWILL be paying back customers \"in full\". [https://reuters.com/technology/ftx-\nabandons-efforts-re-start-its-crypto-\nexchange-2024-01-31/\u2026](https://t.co/D77IttQuWj) \\------- Now, as I stated in\nthe beginning, we aren't sure we haven't both just finally cracked. This is\nliterally just a wild theory concocted by two slightly paranoid security\nresearchers who like to go over things like this for fun on a regular basis.\nWe are absolutely not saying that any of this is \"for sure\", or fact, or\nANYTHING else other than a very remarkable set of coincidences which all line\nup incredibly (and incredulously) well. But, if it's NOT all just one insane\nset of coincidental but ultimately unrelated circumstances - it's quite\npossible that this group of ill-fated sim-swappers have been the FTX hackers\nthis entire time. Maybe we're cracked, or maybe we've cracked it, LOL. If this\nends up being a legit thing, well, ya heard it here first, folks. Feel free to\ncall out any issues with this theory, or you could simply just respond with\n\"no fucking way\" a few times, much like we both did when we were discussing\nit... If you wanna dive more into the details than we did, feel free - by all\nmeans. We mostly just wanted to get this out of our heads and into the public\neye before we both spun ourselves into an even crazier conspiracy theory fit.\n~The End~ ?"
