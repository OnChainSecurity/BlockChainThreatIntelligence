Gladwin\nBy Ryan S. Gladwin\nMay 31, 2024\n3 min read\nGaming. Image: Shutterstock\nGaming. Image: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to bolster the Ethereum layer-2 network\u2019s gaming ecosystem, it appears that over $250 million worth of Arbitrum tokens will be unlocked over the next three years, following strongly positive support for a DAO proposal that\u2019s currently being voted on by token holders.\n\nArbitrum is a scaling network that enables cheaper and faster transactions than the Ethereum mainnet. It\u2019s also attracted a number of prominent gaming projects, including the Xai layer-3 network, Treasure's Infinity Chains, Proof of Play\u2019s on-chain gaming network, the AnimeChain, and the upcoming ApeChain built to power Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed projects via ApeCoin.\n\nBut even with so much gaming action already in the works on Arbitrum, the network\u2019s backers want to encourage even more growth in that direction.\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) aims to empower gaming on the network to the tune of 225 million ARB tokens (just over $255 million) over a three year period. This includes 200 million ARB that will be dedicated specifically towards gaming projects, as well as another 25 million ARB to be used to help administer the funding campaign.\n\n\nArtwork from The MIX.

The MIX, or The Media Indie Exchange, says that it could launch more than 100 games on the layer-3 Xai network before the end of 2024 and that we should see the first of those games live within 60 days. No games have been confirmed yet, however, as they will be announced individually. \"We already...\n\nNews\nGaming\n3 min read\nAndrew Hayward\nMar 20, 2024\nThese tokens will be \"strategically\" allocated focusing on two initiatives. The first initiative, builder onboarding and growth, will receive 160 million ARB tokens in an attempt to attract and support game developers. Funds will be allocated via grants or direct investment in projects, on a deal-by-deal basis.\n\nAs for the second initiative, infrastructure bounties, this will be allocated 40 million ARB tokens to set up the Arbitrum network to properly serve the gaming community it\u2019s aiming to foster. This includes tooling and other technical infrastructure needed to power on-chain games.\n\n\"Publishers and developers will be subject to a robust set of checks and balances to ensure alignment with this proposal\u2019s goals and Arbitrum DAO\u2019s values,\" the DAO proposal says. This process will include the formation of a council of five individuals with gaming expertise which will oversee the program, in addition to support of the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nAs of this writing, the vote has reached quorum and has nearly 83% positive votes-down from approximately 98% positive votes as of Thursday. Voting ends on June 7. Treasure lauded the positive response in a tweet late Wednesday, writing that the proposal was \"on track to being unlocked for Treasure and others focused on gaming within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\"\n\nAD\n\n\nOver the three-year period, the program aims to fund 100 to 200 games, result in over 50 Arbitrum Orbit chains launched, and see more projects migrate to Arbitrum compared to other Ethereum scaling options.\n\nThat said, the proposal acknowledges that it will take some time before the funding initiatives generate results. Namely, most games funded through this program will not be live this year, particularly with grant applications not expected to open until June or July.\n\n\"The GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program,\" the DAO proposal explains. \"After the rollout of the GCP, the aim is to use its learnings to mature the organization into a longer-term gaming program with a comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.\"\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nGG Newsletter\nGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.\nYour Email\nyou@emailaddress.com\n\nGet it!\n\n\n\n\n\nIPFS\nIPFS\n\nRecommended News\nImage: Catizen\n'Catizen' Telegram Game Airdrop: Everything You Need to Know\nCatizen is the latest in a long line of Telegram crypto games taking the world by storm as it dangles a future airdrop in front of players.

Image: Square Enix\n\n\n\n\n\nSquare Enix, the video game giant behind the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts franchises, is adopting another Ethereum scaling network for its Symbiogenesis blockchain game.\n\nThe publisher announced early Thursday that its next NFT character mint for the story-driven game will take place on Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, shifting gears after the first wave of characters was minted on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\"For Chapter 2, we've adopted Arbitrum, reducing the gas fees to about 1/1000 of the previous cost (around 1.3 yen per bid),\" the official Symbiogenesis account tweeted.\n\nWhile the earlier character NFTs were minted on Ethereum, all other in-game NFT assets were minted on Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain scaling network. It\u2019s unclear whether Square Enix plans to continue using Polygon for future game assets, or if it will fully embrace Arbitrum going forward.\n\nAD\n\n\nDecrypt\u2019s GG asked a Square Enix representative for clarification on that question and the decision to use Arbitrum, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nSymbiogenesis is a narrative adventure game built around NFTs, including the aforementioned characters, as well as various in-game items. Only owners of character NFTs can access some parts of the experience, however. There will be 10,000 total characters released for the game.\n\nImage: Square Enix.\n\u2002NFT Revolution\nGamers Are Paying Big Bucks for Square Enix NFT Characters Like 'Egg' and 'Starvation'\nSquare Enix\u2019s first blockchain game project, Symbiogenesis, has released its first batch of Ethereum NFT heroes-and the characters\u2019 names are undeniably curious, to say the least. But they're selling. Someone dropped over $1,200 worth of ETH for an NFT character named \"Egg,\" while another spent over $500 for a hero named \"Starvation.\" Neither Egg nor Starvation bear any physical resemblance to their names\u2019 respective meanings, so it feels a bit like the names could have been spat out of an AI na...\n\nNews\nGaming\n2 min read\nKate Irwin\nDec 5, 2023\nThe first 500 characters were released on Ethereum back in December, and Square Enix saw some social media mockery around the curious names-like \"Egg,\" \"Starvation,\" and \"Wastebasket.\" Currently, the Ethereum NFTs start at a price of under 0.12 ETH (about $445) on secondary marketplaces.\n\nAD\n\nA total of 1,500 new NFT characters will be released on Arbitrum beginning on Friday, May 31 via a public auction. The process will last three days, ending on Sunday, with the characters released in small batches over the span. Square Enix has posted a how-to guide about bridging assets to Arbitrum One in preparation for the auction.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nGG Newsletter\nGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.\nYour Email\nyou@emailaddress.com\n\nGet it!\n\n\n\n\n\nIPFS\nIPFS\n\nNFT Revolution\nNFTs are provably unique crypto tokens that are quickly becoming increasingly popular among digital artists, gaming companies, and investors.
