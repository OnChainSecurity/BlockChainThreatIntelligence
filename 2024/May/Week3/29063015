Other assets taken include 3,000 USDC on BNB Chain, including 0.5 PENDLE and 0.1 WBTC on Arbitrum. At the time of reporting, the address still holds $7,000 in crypto assets.\n\nYou might also like: Binance executive denied bail in Nigerian money laundering case\nThe exploiter\u2019s address still retains the stolen assets at last check, boasting a balance of roughly $220,000 across several chains. The attackers exploited the victim by deploying a multi-call function, which allows multiple smart contract functions to be executed in a single transaction.\n\nHackers exploit this by tricking users into signing transactions that appear legitimate but actually include malicious multi-call functions. The code allows the malicious actor to transfer funds or interact with contracts without the user\u2019s intended consent, leading to the loss of assets.\n\nThis year, the crypto space has experienced several phishing attacks, albeit with a reduced frequency. Recently, an unidentified market participant fell victim to such a scam, resulting in a substantial loss of over $674,000 in USDC, highlighting the ongoing threat of these fraudulent schemes.\n\nMoreover, this incident mirrors similar phishing attacks reported earlier this month, where a victim lost $145,000 worth of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs. In that case, three BAYC NFTs were stolen.\n\nIn another incident reported in April 2024, a trader lost over $180,000 in USDC and Andy tokens. The attackers employed a similar multi-call tactic, combining multiple function calls into a single transaction, leading to outflows from the victim\u2019s address to several wallets controlled by the hackers.\n\nRead more: Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: SOL, BONK, FTM"
