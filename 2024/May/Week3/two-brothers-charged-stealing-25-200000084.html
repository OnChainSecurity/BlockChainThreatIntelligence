Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, both in their 20s, face more than 20 years in prison if found guilty.More from Robb Report\n\nDefrauded FTC Customers Are Getting All of Their Money Back-Plus Interest\n\nThe 'World's First NFT Restaurant' Is Selling Memberships for U.S. Dollars Now\n\nDisgraced FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Is Asking for a Shorter Prison Sentence\n\n\"The Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,\" Lisa Monaco, the U.S. deputy attorney general, said.\n\nThe Department of Justice noted that this is the first such crypto heist it has seen. The Peraire-Bueno brothers studied mathematics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the BBC wrote, and prosecutors say they used the skills they learned there to exploit Ethereum\u2019s system. They were apparently able to steal the millions of dollars in crypto by hacking into Ethereum traders\u2019 pending transactions and rerouting the money to themselves. When a representative for the blockchain got in touch with them, they refused to return the money and then tried to launder and hide it.\n\n\"The defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Exploit,\" as investigators have called the scheme, took place back in April 2023. It\u2019s the first time this sort of fraud is resulting in criminal charges, the BBC noted. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the first time crypto has become caught up in high-level legal proceedings.\n\nMost notably in the States, the disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing $8 billion from his customers. Over in Turkey, Faruk Fatih \u00d6zer, who created the failed Thodex exchange, was given an 11,196-year jail term. And the Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges and said he would pay a $50 million fine.\n\nAll those cases involved men who held positions of power in the crypto world, making this week\u2019s case an outlier. The Peraire-Bueno brothers were able to infiltrate Ethereum from the outside and make a break for it with $25 million in their (digital) pockets. That money, though, will not have been theirs for very long.\n\n"
