How did they know my transactions? And how were they able to transfer money? None of those things have been answered yet.\"\n\nThe person told Michelle that someone was trying to wire money to Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, her husband Mike called Chase on his own to confirm there was a real emergency, and the bank confirmed that fraud attempts were indeed taking place.\n\nHowever, confirming the fraud with Chase employees was apparently not enough to stop the scammer on the phone from accessing the Kalistas\u2019 money.\n\nMike says there were two unsuccessful wire attempts from their bank account, which is when Chase should have frozen the funds. However, that didn\u2019t happen, and on the third attempt, $22,000 disappeared.\n\nSays Michelle,\n\n\"I mean, it was panic, and then it was tears, and then it was I\u2019m made\u2026 I mean, I am literally emotionally exhausted at this point.\"\n\nChase says that after investigation, the trillion-dollar bank determined that the Kalistas \"authorized or (they) received benefit\" from the transactions, and will not reimburse the family.\n\nChase contacted the local news outlet saying that \"these types of scams are heartbreaking,\" but also confirmed its \"decision to deny (Michelle\u2019s) claim because she compromised her account.\"\n\nSimilar scams appear to be on the rise across the US.\n\nA Memphis woman recently discovered $81,000 missing from her Wells Fargo account, and is worried she won\u2019t receive a single cent back.\n\nAnd 70-year-old Houston resident Jodene Danials also says Chase isn\u2019t taking responsibility after her account was gutted by cyber thieves for $4,500.\n\nTwo other Wells Fargo customers say the bank is \"rolling their eyes\" at them after $83,000 went missing, and is refusing to reimburse.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat - Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Fantom says Sonic will \"scale the network to unprecedented heights\" and can process 2,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe new technology will also reduce storage requirements by up to 90%, according to the project.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only recent tech development for the project: Last month, Fantom announced a new \"canonical\" stablecoin in partnership with USDC-issuer Circle.\n\nFantom said it utilized the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) to roll out the new stablecoin, USDC.e.\n\nExplained the Fantom Foundation,\n\n\"USDC.e on Wormhole is bridged from native USDC, located in a smart contract on Ethereum, and holds the potential to be upgraded to native USDC in the future. It will be the official, endorsed stablecoin of the Fantom ecosystem (and all future network upgrades).\"\n\nThis initiative reduces liquidity fragmentation, introduces stability, and provides additional on-ramps to the ecosystem. By leveraging the Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard, USDC.e will be available to all users and developers on Fantom.\"\n\nDon't Miss a Beat - Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
