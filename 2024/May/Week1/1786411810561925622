        "original_content": "a few weeks ago i did interviews, coding puzzles, all the silly bullshit, all\nto get a \"junior engineer\" offer from smg/consensys for half the pay and\ndouble the hours i quoted. they even cited the fact that i don't have degree\ncompanies that demand degrees are not worth your time companies that demand\nleetcode are not worth your time and this is exactly why we're on the\nfrontier, this is especially true in crypto. when you're close to the heat,\nanything goes. it doesn't matter how it happens, just make it happen. we're\nbuilding money printing tech in a money printing industry any company that\ncan't recognize this and falls back on such silly filtering systems does so bc\neither they're so entrenched in a bureaucratic system that the only way they\ncan justify the salary a software pioneer deserves is by requiring every trad\nlabel that makes them look good to the bean counter.. or they're a follower.\nboth will give you problems you can start at youtube tutorials and, through\nopen source contributions and a conference here and there, you can become the\nvery best and you can set your price no degrees, no certs, just oss and\nautistically rambling about the right thing to the right person at a happy\nhour. that's all it takes"
