It helped me WIN my\nfirst\n\n[@code4rena](/code4rena)\n\ncontest back in November ?\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GOPtHurWAAAIg0B?format=png&name=small)](/0x3b33/status/1793540232484168122/photo/1)\n\nAnd it helped me get a chance to work with\n\n[@GuardianAudits](/GuardianAudits)\n\n, auditing some of the biggest names in crypto\n?. This isn't a technique\nto do while auditing ?, but\none to do after the audit has finished\n?. This tweet is for the\nsecurity researchers who don't know what it is\n? but are eager to improve\ntheir skills ?. Firstly,\nwhen I started, like most of you, I hopped from contest to contest. As you\nwould expect, this yielded 0 results\n?. Then the all-too-common\npattern started occurring - missing a bug in one audit, and missing the same\nkind of bug in the next audit. After a lot of thinking and figuring out, a\nmethod was found ![?](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f929.svg). After\nevery audit, I would review the valid findings, re-write them (in a .md file),\nand ask very specific questions that would have led me to this bug. What do\nyou know... some bug patterns repeat themselves in codebase after codebase\n![?](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f604.svg). Here are the technical\ndetails that you need to know in order to do it in your next audit: 1\\. After\nthe initial presort, read every valid finding one by one. 2\\. After reading a\nfinding, summarize it in 2-3 sentences. If you don't understand it, read it\nagain. 3\\. Give an example or a step flow if it will make it easier to\nunderstand. 4\\. Write 3 or more questions that would help you find this bug\nnext time.\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GOPuHjYXIAApSYu?format=jpg&name=medium)](/0x3b33/status/1793540232484168122/photo/2)\n\nAnd remember - making mistakes isn't bad, repeating them is..."
