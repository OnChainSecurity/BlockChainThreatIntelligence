Industries like financial institutions, banking, food, gaming, health care, etc. are major users of blockchain technology. \n\nHowever, a blockchain network can have certain flaws that can affect the organisation and its security outcomes. \n\n\nBlockchain security audits are a great way to find the issues concerning security, compliance,  and operations. These audits evaluate the network and systems to detect malicious activities and prevent exploitation. \n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll discuss:\n\nWhat are blockchain security audits?\nWhy are blockchain security audits essential?\nBlockchain Security Checklist\nThe Cost of Blockchain Security AuditWhat are Blockchain Security Audits?\nA blockchain security audit is a step-by-step review of your overall system on a given blockchain network to detect and assess compliance risks, security vulnerabilities, operational dysfunctions, etc. These errors could be malicious and can harm the entire business environment. \n\nBlockchain security audits help you understand where the issues lie and let you resolve them quickly to secure your network. In addition to this, it ensures your organisation follows the rules, regulations, and protocols thoroughly to prevent attacks. \n\nStats on Blockchain Security Audits\nThe Blockchain security market is predicted to expand from USD$ 3.15 Billion in 2024 to USD$ 58.86 Billion by 2032 with a CAGR of 44.20%.\nAccording to a study, around $2.81 billion were lost in 2022 alone due to smart contract security hacks. Why do you Need a Blockchain Security Audit?\nBlockchain security audits are a secure way to detect errors in a blockchain network and review the systems and their internal workings. It\u2019s an important procedure for every business leveraging blockchain technology. \n\nHere are the reasons why implementing blockchain security audits is beneficial: \n\nDocument Integrity\nDocuments like smart contracts are being used in blockchain applications for quick and automatic execution of transactions. With blockchain security audits, you can identify vulnerabilities in your system and minimise the risk of security breaches. \n\nVulnerability Reduction \nIn the blockchain network, vulnerabilities can cause many problems, especially harming your security and stealing essential information. Blockchain security audits identify and resolve these vulnerabilities before they can cause any damage, preventing unauthorised access, and potential security breaches. \n\nRegulatory Compliance\nDue to data privacy risks, regulatory compliance needs have become more stringent than ever. Therefore, you must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Blockchain security audits help ensure your organisation is in compliance with applicable regulations. This helps you build a legal and transparent environment in your enterprise's blockchain network. \n\nBlockchain Security Audit Cost\nThe blockchain security audit cost can start from $5,000 and go up to $50,000, depending on many factors, such as scope, complexity, compliance requirements, and team size. Blockchain Security: Testing Checklist\n\n1. Understanding Blockchain Architecture\nUnderstanding  blockchain architecture is the first step to securing your blockchain network. Since blockchain is decentralised, it replaces a traditional server-based centralised architecture to offer greater privacy, stability, and security. \n\nBlockchain utilises cryptography and transparency to protect your digital assets in the network. Its basic components, including nodes, blocks, transactions, chains, and miners help you perform blockchain security audits effortlessly.\n\n2. Detecting Threat Entry Points\nWeak entry points within your organisation can allow attackers to access and interact with your digital systems and collect sensitive data. \n\nWith regular blockchain security audits, you can identify these entry points and secure your organisation's data from threats. For this, build a threat model for your organisation so that everyone in the team understands and acts accordingly. \n\nIn your threat modeling, you can include the following things:\n\nIdentify your organisation's objectives to maintain a security layer within it\nDefine your objectives to your team and let them follow each objective\nAnalyse vulnerable applications\nIdentify potential threats\nPut strategies and countermeasures in place\nGenerate a report to know how it performs\n\n3. Collecting Available Data\nThere could be weaknesses in your hardware, software, and network systems that a malicious actor can find and exploit. If you have not set strong measures or permissions to protect your sensitive data, attackers can access this information and damage your systems. \n\nBefore that happens, collect information about those weaknesses and fix them. In addition, find data that anyone can easily access and secure it with advanced access permissions so that only authorised individuals can access it. \n\n4. Evaluating Smart Contracts\nThe smart contract contains rules, workflows, and functions. This ensures everyone in the organisation operates according to the contract and meets your business requirements. Blockchain security audits help you evaluate your smart contract by inspecting whether everyone performs as per the code. \n\n5. Establishing Objectives\nSecurity testing is crucial for every business to detect vulnerabilities in a system and ensure data safety from attackers. \n\nFor this, establish your audit objectives and prioritise workflow based on the degree of severity. Identify security loopholes in your systems and rank them according to how much risk they pose. Start fixing them one by one, ensuring you address the most critical issues first before they affect your business.  It helps you protect your business from data breaches and unauthorised access. \n\n6. Designing a Full Strategy Model\nYou will require a full strategy model to protect your business from attackers. This is one of the blockchain security audit best practices that help you prepare yourself for incoming attacks. To design a full strategy plan, define your business objectives, identify potential threats, and take a testing approach. It will protect your data and resources from attackers.\n\n7. Ensuring Compliance Readiness\nEnsure your organisation follows all the industry standards, legal commitments, and internal requirements.
