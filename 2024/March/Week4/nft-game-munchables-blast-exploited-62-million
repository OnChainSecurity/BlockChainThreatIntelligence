        "original_content": "Crypto game Munchables on Blast exploited for $63MA new NFT game built on the Ethereum layer 2 Blast has been exploited for nearly 17,500 ETH.A nonfungible token (NFT) game called Munchables, built on Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Blast, has suffered a $62-million exploit. \n\nMunchables announced it had been compromised in a March 26 X post at 9:33 pm UTC and said it was tracking the exploiter\u2019s movements and \"attempting to stop the transactions.\"Blockchain analyst ZachXBT responded to the post with the wallet address of the alleged attacker, which currently touts a balance of $62.45 million in Ether \nETH\n\ntickers down\n$2,318\n\n, per Blastscan data. \n\nThe wallet address of the exploiter shows that it interacted with the Munchables protocol at 9:26 am UTC, extracting a total of 17,413 ETH, per DeBank data.The exploiter\u2019s address with over 17,400 ETH incoming from Munchables. Source: DeBank\nThe exploiter\u2019s wallet address then transferred $10,700 worth of ETH through the Orbiter Bridge, transferring the Blast ETH back into native ETH. At 10:05 pm UTC, the wallet sent an additional 1 ETH to a fresh wallet address. \n\nZachXBT claimed the exploit stemmed from the Munchables team hiring a North Korean developer known by the alias \"Werewolves0943.\" \n\nIn a March 27 X post, Solidity developer 0xQuit claimed that the Munchables attack had been planned from the outset, with one of the developers upgrading the Lock contract - which is meant to lock tokens in for a specified time - with a new implementation shortly before launch. \n\n\"There were appropriate checks to ensure you couldn\u2019t withdraw more than you deposited. But before upgrading, the attacker was able to assign himself a deposited balance of 1,000,000 Ether,\" 0xQuit explained.\"[The] scammer used manual manipulation of storage slots to assign himself an enormous Ether balance before changing the contract implementation to one that appears legit. Then he simply withdrew that balance once TVL was juicy enough,\" added 0xQuit. \n\nMunchables is a Blast-based GameFi app revolving around NFT-based creatures. The Munchables protocol allows players to stake Blast ETH and Blast USD to farm Blast points and unlock added in-game perks. \n\nRelated: Blast launches Ethereum L2 mainnet unlocking $2.3B in staked crypto\n\nSeveral X users, including pseudonymous metaverse adviser Cygaar, have called on the Blast team to intervene by forcibly rolling back the chain to before the exploit occurred.\n\n\"An invalid state root would need to be forced by the Blast team which would erase the hacked transaction. The chain might need to halt completely to do this,\" added Cygaar.\"It wouldn\u2019t set a good precedent for future exploits/issues, but it is possible.\"\nOthers pushed back against calls for centralized intervention, as it runs against the ethos of decentralized networks - Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran argued that it would be \"on brand\" for Blast to intervene. \n\n\"Given that, it doesn\u2019t seem off-brand for them to intervene in defense of user experience. Optimism is ethos alignment, but Blast is gamified social user experience,\" Cochran wrote, adding:\n\n\"While I\u2019m strongly against this action on any other chain, I don\u2019t take Blast as a brand of \u2018serious decentralization chain\u2019 but instead as a place for games, experiments, degenry, etc.\""
