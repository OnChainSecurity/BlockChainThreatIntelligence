But, in AI, a model being open greatly increases its vulnerability to adversarial machine learning attacks.AI and web3\nAnalysts have said that the combination of innovations from AI and web3 could result in the emergence of a flourishing cryptocurrency subsector in 2024. Nansen analyst Sandra Leow emphasized the development of AI agents, a field that combines elements of AI and web3. \n\n\"We could foresee a world where AI agents become a primary category of users on the blockchain, and some examples include verification management applications that use zero-knowledge learning technologies like Modulus Labs,\" Leow told The Block in December."
