        "original_content": "Visual analytics for security threats detection in Ethereum consensus layerAbstract\nThe Ethereum consensus layer provides the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm with the beacon chain for the Ethereum blockchain network. However, the beacon chain is proved vulnerable to consensus-targeted attacks, which are difficult to detect. To address this issue, blockchain developers require an interactive tool to identify and mitigate potential security threats. Currently, most blockchain visualization solutions only display client logs or transaction records, making responding quickly to security threats challenging. This paper introduces the first visual analytics solution for security threat awareness on the Ethereum consensus layer. We cooperate with blockchain experts and investigate a top-down exploration approach, providing an overview of the general security level, as well as detailed consensus achievements in each slot. Our visual system lets users discover specific outcomes of the consensus execution and identify anomalies in the beacon chain historical data. Furthermore, the system includes two case studies of actual attacks to help developers better understand and mitigate potential security threats.\nGraphical abstract"
