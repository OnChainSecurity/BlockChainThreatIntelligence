        "original_content": "\n\nThe Lazarus Crew, a notorious cybercrime group linked to North Korea, has \nexecuted\n a $12 million Ethereum transaction via Twister Money to avoid US sanctions. This move follows their previous cyber-attack in November, targeting HTX and Heco Bridge, resulting in $100 million in losses.\n\n\nDespite sanctions, Twister Money remains operational, posing challenges to international law enforcement due to its decentralized nature. The resilience of Twister Money\u2019s decentralized structure enables it to evade sanctions and operate with impunity. This resistance to legal constraints raises debates on cryptocurrency regulations and enforcement.\n\n\nLazarus Group\u2019s recent activities pose an ongoing challenge to international law enforcement agencies striving to combat cryptocurrency money laundering. Facing increased regulatory scrutiny, the Lazarus Group demonstrates adaptability by shifting tactics, such as using Twister Money after crackdowns on other platforms like Blender and Sinbad.\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: \nCraig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, The Creator of Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
