        "original_content": "Few reflections on our\n\n[@OpusMoney](/OpusMoney)\n\nx\n\n[@code4rena](/code4rena)\n\ncontest now that it's over: Going into the contest, I felt pretty confident\nabout our code. We spend a lot of time on reviews (design & code), have an\nextensive test suite, plus just before the contest started we wrapped up an\naudit with a traditional security firm. Oh boy, was I in for a surprise. The\nwardens revealed 4 highs (two of them really embarrassing that we should've\ncaught ?) & 9 mediums.\nNeedless to say, I'm very happy they did; they made Opus better. We've already\nmitigated all issues found and are working on bringing Opus to mainnet\nsoon? I'm now also a full\nconvert to the open contest way of doing security audits. The ROI is just\nincredible. C4 is doing an amazing job at amassing talent from all over the\nworld and giving them a venue to apply their skills in a fair way to the\nbenefit of all involved parties. I noticed there are wardens that specialize\non certain areas (MEV extraction, financial attacks, mechanism design, etc.)\nand thanks to C4 you can get them to asses your protocol. There's just no way\na traditional firm can offer this level of scrutiny for the same money.\nThere's also a downside to the open nature of a contest. Anyone can submit,\nhence anyone does. We got a lot of obvious chatGPT generated submissions, a\nlot of low quality ones (reporting something when it's \"works as designed\"),\netc. People are just incentivized to fill in everything in hopes of getting a\nreward. Note I'm not criticizing submissions of low severity issues, I agree\nwith\n\n[@sockdrawermoney](/sockdrawermoney)\n\nhere, there's value in those too. I'm just saying there's a lot of garbage.\nHowever C4 is doing a pretty good job at filtering that out during the\nscreening process. I'd also like to highlight 0xsomeone who was the judge on\nour contest. That guy is *amazing*. We were super impressed by his ability to\ngrasp complexities of our protocol and navigate between the wardens'\nsubmissions and our comments. What a chad! Finally, this was the first ever\nStarknet/Cairo contest on C4 so I was also curious how it will go. There was a\n3 week bootcamp prior to our audit (thank you\n\n[@espejelomar](/espejelomar)\n\n[@barretodavid](/barretodavid)\n\n[@robertkp13](/robertkp13)\n\n) and from what I can tell, it was worthwhile. Sure, there were people who\ntreated it like EVM (\"no check of caller address zero\" etc.), but the best\npeople understood the platform and tooling and submitted issues with a full\nPoC built using Cairo & Scarb. Great to see\n? So overall I'm very happy\nwith the process and results it bore. I want to once again thank you to all\nthe people involved, it's been a great experience."
