Others promise extremely high yields or offer exclusive digital goods, as seen in NFT rug pulls.\nCrypto rug pulls can also occur when the project\u2019s owners manipulate the value of a particular token or coin to deceive investors and subsequently siphon off their investments.\nFraudsters often attract victims with a sudden, sharp increase in the token\u2019s value in a short period. Once the price peaks, the people behind the token sell it to generate a profit while leaving \"investors\" with steep losses.\nRug pulls often occur on decentralized trading platforms, enabling the fraudster to benefit from the pseudonymity of DEXes.Types of Rug Pulls\nRug pulls can generally be categorized into hard and soft rug pulls.\nHard rug pulls are more acute and sudden. Investors can lose all their funds within a short time. Soft rug pulls happen over a longer period. The core development team gives investors a false sense of security while they quietly shut down.\nCommon types of rug pulls include:\nLiquidity Pulls: Malicious actors remove liquidity from a token pool, causing the token\u2019s value to plummet due to a lack of buyers and sellers.\nFake Projects: Scammers create seemingly legitimate projects, gather investments, and then disappear with the funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens.\nPump and Dump: Fraudsters artificially inflate the price of a token through coordinated buying, only to sell their holdings at the peak and crash the value.\nTeam Exit: The project\u2019s team members suddenly disappear or exit, leaving investors with no support and a collapsing token.\nHow To Identify & Avoid Rug Pulls\nIdentifying and avoiding rug pulls requires a combination of diligence and caution. Here\u2019s how you can protect yourself:\nThorough research: Investigate the project\u2019s team, technology, goals, and community before investing. Look for red flags such as unknown teams or lack of transparency.\nSecurity audits: Reputable projects often undergo third-party security audits. Check if the project has been audited and review the audit report for vulnerabilities.\nCommunity engagement: Engage with the project\u2019s community on social media and forums. A strong and active community can indicate a legitimate project.\nWarning signs: Be cautious of unrealistic returns and yields, excessive marketing, and pressure to invest quickly. Trust your instincts and avoid FOMO.\nFinally, always ensure you only invest money you can afford to lose. Many cryptocurrency projects are experimental, and sometimes the failure of an idea can lead to the team doing a soft rug pull, which means they quietly stop supporting the project.\n5 Biggest Crypto Rug Pulls in History\nWhile crypto rug pulls have always been a spectacle in the industry, some scams left a mark in the industry.\nHere\u2019s a look at five of history\u2019s biggest crypto rug pulls.\nOneCoin\nOneCoin was a cryptocurrency-based Ponzi scheme promoted as a new digital currency that would revolutionize the financial world. The scheme was run by Ruja Ignatova, who claimed that OneCoin was backed by a team of experts and had a vast network of distributors.\nHowever, OneCoin was never actually backed by anything, and the distributors were simply paid to recruit new investors. When the scheme eventually collapsed, investors lost over $4 billion.\nThodex\nThodex was a Turkish cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked in 2021. The hacker stole over $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency from Thodex users, and the exchange\u2019s founder, Faruk \u00d6zer, then disappeared. \u00d6zer was later arrested in Albania in 2022.\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnubisDAO\nAnubisDAO was a DeFi project launched in 2021. The project promised high returns to investors, but it was a rug pull. The developers drained the project\u2019s liquidity pool and disappeared, leaving investors with nothing.\nUranium Finance\nUranium Finance was a DeFi project that promised to provide investors with exposure to uranium mining, but it was yet another rug pull. The developers of Uranium Finance drained the project\u2019s liquidity pool and vanished, leaving token holders with heavy losses.\nSquid Game Token\nSquid Game Token was a scam cryptocurrency created in 2021, inspired by the popular Netflix series \"Squid Game.\" However, the token was a rug pull. The developers disabled the token\u2019s ability to be sold, and then disappeared with investors\u2019 money.\nCrypto rug pulls remain a significant threat in the crypto space, preying on unsuspecting investors and causing substantial financial losses.\nBy understanding the various types of rug pulls, learning how to identify early warning signs, and implementing best practices for investing, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to these malicious schemes."
