Source: Scam Sniffer\nScam Sniffer found that Ethereum mainnet accounted for 78% of the total thefts, with ERC-20 tokens being the main assets stolen, accounting for 86% of all assets stolen.\n\nIt added that most Ethereum token thefts were due to users signing phishing signatures and transaction approvals, such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance and Uniswap Permit2.\n\nMoreover, most wallet drainers have now started using account abstraction wallets as token approval spenders, it noted.\n\nAccount abstraction enables more functionality and smart contract compatibility for Ethereum wallets.\n\nDespite a higher number of phishing victims than in January, February saw a reduction in the total amount stolen compared to the first month of the year. February also saw a vast reduction in the number of victims who lost over $1 million.\n\n\nScreenshot of Scam Sniffer phishing stats.
