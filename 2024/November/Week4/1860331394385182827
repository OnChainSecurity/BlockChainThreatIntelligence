When number go up for scammers, crypto\nusers lose everything. The battle against wallet drainers has been ongoing\nsince before I was born into crypto. We owe a lot of progress to individuals\nand teams who are on the frontlines, working tirelessly to protect users from\nyour favorite threat actors who\u2019ve left a trail of victims in their wake.\n\n[@Cointelegraph](/Cointelegraph)\n\ncovered the opinions of\n\n[@0xFantasy](/0xFantasy)\n\n, named as an investigator for\n\n[@FairsideNetwork](/FairsideNetwork)\n\n, formerly\n\n[@blowfishxyz](/blowfishxyz)\n\n, and co-founder of\n\n[@BlockMageSec](/BlockMageSec)\n\n, who has played an involved role in uncovering scams and providing thoughts\nto the crypto community.\n\n[@evilcos](/evilcos)\n\nwas also quoted for thoughts on why Drainers are retiring. This does not bring\nmuch comfort to the space. Taking a moment to shout out the BlockMage team\n\n[@Alchemyst0x](/Alchemyst0x)\n\nand others have been key players in early scam hunting efforts, analyzing the\nvarying tactics. Early on, we highlighted warning signs of scammers and\nprovided support to the tools saving users. Even with retirements from\nDrainers, the battle is far from over, and many others have joined in to make\nthe crypto ecosystem safer. I wrote an article on\n\n[@Medium](/Medium)\n\nand mentioned some de obfuscation work by\n\n[@muellerberndt](/muellerberndt)\n\n[@0xFantasy](/0xFantasy)\n\nand others were apart of early efforts at that as well.\n\n[@1c4m3by](/1c4m3by)\n\n[@Plumferno](/Plumferno)\n\n& Mages were in the dungeons\n? scheming against the\nschemers.\n\n[@wallet_guard](/wallet_guard)\n\nand\n\n[@PocketUniverseZ](/PocketUniverseZ)\n\nGuardians developed tools to help users detect and avoid malicious links and\nphishing attempts along with\n\n[@MetaMask](/MetaMask)\n\nand others. Then we have teams like\n\n[@BoringSecDAO](/BoringSecDAO)\n\nand\n\n[@pudgypenguins](/pudgypenguins)\n\nwho foster security minded communities\n\n[@Kerberus](/Kerberus)\n\njoined and is just as impactful in saving users.\n\n[@nft_dreww](/nft_dreww)\n\nhelped me uncover a Browser extension where Inferno Drainer kit was injected\ninto the DOM, targeting the\n\n[@blur_io](/blur_io)\n\nteam. He\u2019s also posted the details of how some of these DM conversations lead\nto the same sc@m pages or worse, MALWARE!! Myself and a small group\n\n[@Cap_Plantain](/Cap_Plantain)\n\n[@beausecurity](/beausecurity)\n\nand a few others worked on uncovering vulnerabilities in Twitter\nauthentication process to understand how scammers compromised numerous\naccounts such as\n\n[@gitcoin](/gitcoin)\n\nand the almighty\n\n[@VitalikButerin](/VitalikButerin)\n\nto post ph1shing links ?\nAngel Drainer targeted\n\n[@Ledger](/Ledger)\n\nand ended up performing what I claimed to be the first supply chain attack in\ncrypto of its type. Compromising the Connect Kit used by\n\n[@RevokeCash](/RevokeCash)\n\nand others, users urgently needing to revoke approvals from ANY of the above\ndrainers were DOUBLE at risk for losing more funds/assets as they tried to\nsave them. Today, while DPRK makes off with millions from other means of\nexploitation ( The real IT workers of DPRK exposed by\n\n[@zachxbt](/zachxbt)\n\nand tracked prefusely by\n\n[@tayvano_](/tayvano_)\n\n) we now have to battle the AI threat\n?\n\n[@OpenAI](/OpenAI)\n\nchatGPT pointed an unsuspecting user to a\n\n[@solana](/solana)\n\nphishing site, RECOMMENDED DURING CODE GENERATION. How a phishing website\nappeared in AI based results? Take your guesses. This is all for the purpose\nof understanding how this particular threat has evolved and why as a community\nour guard should not be down. History shows drainers are like hydra, one\nretires and two others come to cradle the client base. More importantly, the\nlast topic \u261d\ufe0f about how\nChatGPT found a scam link and recommended it to a user opens an entirely new\nlane for \u201chow to protect users?\u201d when you aren\u2019t clicking a link\n? it\u2019s being embedded into\ncode from an AI/LLM.
