        "original_content": "A message to the attacker (respond by nov 14th, 8am cet) Yesterday we sent you\nan on-chain message on:\n[https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x991559bd8e1725714724267071c9ec8cbf31117497cdf259cfd662b0151c2da1\u2026](https://t.co/Xl2t2Egv6X).\nIt seems like you either missed this message, or decided to postpone a\nresponse in order to farm more rewards on LFJ and Stargate. We are confident\nin your eventual willingness to talk, given how you handled the funds so far.\nHowever, due to the seriousness of the situation we do want to urge you to\nstart the conversation asap. As I am sure you know, we have several leads on\nyour real identity, and at some point we will have to pursue these in order to\nretrieve the user funds. Safe fund retrieval is our sole priority In the past\nwe have shown to stick to our word of complete anonymity. The last attacker\nwho collaborated with us can- and agreed to vouch for this, if so desired. Of\ncourse I'm fully aware that most of the above is unnecessary to mention, due\nto your apparent willingness to talk. You can reach me on Blockscan by sending\na message to: 0x5446ee1686AA82A0A5f9c300173244Fa5eE087a7.  In order to prevent\ncontinuous farming, making us have to guess when we would need to start taking\nnext steps (legal and otherwise), we will put a deadline to the point where we\nconsider this to be a whitehat hack: Please reach out to me before Nov 14th,\n8am CET in order to open the conversation. Looking forward to talking to you,\nGavin Hasselbaink Cofounder / CBDO DeltaPrime"
