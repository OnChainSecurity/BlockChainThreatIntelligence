I\u2019d like to inform you that\nyour Bridge contract has a critical issue. You mistakenly exposed multiple\nfunctions that allow accepting of forged messages cross-chain and gave those\npermissions to your contract owner - allowing you to take tokens out of any\nwallet at any point in time, arbitrarily draining any Stargate pool.\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gab0-ZDXQAAKpCb?format=jpg&name=medium)](/trust__90/status/1848434236367556860/photo/4)\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gab0rkGXoAAQIEO?format=jpg&name=900x900)](/trust__90/status/1848434236367556860/photo/2)\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gab0rkIWIAACH-m?format=jpg&name=900x900)](/trust__90/status/1848434236367556860/photo/3)\n\n[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gab0rkKXQAE6ipg?format=png&name=small)](/trust__90/status/1848434236367556860/photo/1)\n\nTo fix the issue without needing to reissue your entire Stargate deployment:\nTransfer ownership to a new smart contract that prevents arbitrarily rugging\nthe entire TVL. Since this is a permanent vulnerability, the new contract must\nbe immutable, and it should not include any functionality to transfer\nownership. You currently have a bug bounty program which offers 10% of funds\nat risk, which is $440,358,246 according to your website. You've already\nagreed instant rug vector is a valid critical, so please send a cheque for\n$44M in favor of Trust Security. Alternatively, publicly state you are full of\nbullsh*t and are simply preying on smaller projects for a bit of engagement\nfluff. Best of luck -Trust"
