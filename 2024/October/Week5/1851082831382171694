        "original_content": "SlowMist was engaged to act as an independent third-party to investigate the\nrecent incident that resulted in the theft of\n[$EIGEN]\ntokens.?\ufe0f Following a\nthorough investigation, SlowMist concluded that the incident started from an\nexternal malicious attack: one of Eigen Labs\u2019 investors was the victim of a\nphishing attack that resulted in one of the Investor\u2019s employee\u2019s email\naccounts being compromised. This allowed the Attacker to access an email\nthread between the investor, Eigen Labs, and a custodian, where the parties\ndiscussed transferring EIGEN to the custodian who would hold the tokens on\nbehalf of the Investor. This email thread was forwarded to the Attacker from\nthe Investor\u2019s email. The Attacker created and used spoofed (very slightly\naltered) email addresses of the investor and custodian, then posing as the\nInvestor, the Attacker responded to the legitimate email ID such that the\nresponse appeared in the same legitimate email thread with the attacker\u2019s\nwallet address rather than the intended custodian wallet address. Using the\nspoofed Investor email address in the same email thread, the attacker then\nconfirmed receipt of the test transaction. Similarly, from a spoofed custodian\nemail address, the attacker separately confirmed receipt of the test\ntransaction - all appearing in the same thread as the initial legitimate\nthread. After receiving confirmation from what appeared to be the Investor and\nthe custodian, but were in fact nearly identical fraudulent email addresses,\nwithout a further communication channel confirmation, the remaining ~1.67M\n[$EIGEN] were sent to the Attacker\u2019s\nwallet.\n[https://x.com/eigenlayer/status/1842317191045157099\u2026](/eigenlayer/status/1842317191045157099)"
