        "original_content": "With the spread of digitalization and the Internet of Things, information security is increasingly enmeshed in many aspects of our society [\n1\n]. Digital information not only offers advantages but also creates security threats. In handling these threats, cybersecurity is of paramount significance because it provides defensive methods to detect the potential intimidations [\n2\n]. However, the majority of the defensive methods are not very effective. Additionally, individuals have tunnel vision regarding information security basics, and they do not know much about other ways to consider and improve cybersecurity awareness. Despite the level of spending, public awareness, and readiness in certain fields, most users do not yet think of computer security as anything but a nuisance [\n3\n]. Cybercriminals try to access personal and private information that poses a threat to privacy and confidentiality [\n4\n]. Cybercrime can be regarded as computer-mediated activities that are either illegal or considered illicit by certain parties, and these activities can be conducted through global networks [\n5\n]. Therefore, the main question is whether it is possible to avoid any cybercrime by knowing the basics of cybersecurity in the mainstream. As modern technologies are used everywhere globally and by almost everyone on the Internet, this issue affects all of them. Cybercrime is switching its battleground from desktops to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and VoIPs [\n6\n]. This includes stealing, such as by capturing everything people type, including passwords, bank accounts, and credit card numbers [\n7\n]. Cyber fraud, stealing, phishing, and other malicious behaviors will enrich the terminology of cybercrime in the years ahead [\n8\n]. It is not sufficient to only follow the recommended cybersecurity standards, rules, and anti-cybercrime actions to avoid cybercrimes. There are obvious risks caused by this problem, such as large business losses and the dispersion of prohibited themes, such as cultural and racial hate, violence, child porn, and cyberterrorism. Currently, cybercrime has emerged as the biggest threat to the computer information technology (IT) industry that has taken shape [\n9\n]. Security is being employed in different organizations to protect their assets, but it does not fully provide safeguards [\n10\n]. As an increasing number of users and businesses use emerging technologies, awareness is becoming one of the most predominant issues [\n11\n]. Some cybercriminals are interested in gaining financial access, whereas others seek to get consumer information or intellectual property, harm an organization\u2019s reputation, or release a political declaration through \u201chacktivism\u201d [\n12\n]. The question is whether the fight against cybercriminals can be won or lost. The answer is to depend on individuals\u2019 current cybersecurity knowledge about protecting against cybercrimes so that businesses can be more resistant to cybersecurity attacks. Even if law enforcement reduces the rate of cybercrimes, the issue is to avoid them entirely [\n13\n]. A lack of structural stability and continuity within an organization may interrupt efforts to efficiently address the issue of online crime [\n14\n]. The government has also made considerable efforts to educate consumers regarding the risks of identity crime, especially the forms that occur online [\n15\n,\n16\n]. Individuals can also be protected from cybercriminals with the advantages of existing laws [\n17\n]. However, this disintermediation of the news process runs counter to the construction of the imagery surrounding cybercrime, which originated in the days before the Internet when the mass media was organized more centrally [\n16\n]. It is predicted that a 25% increase in identity theft until 2027 will cause a \n$\n40.62 billion loss [\n18\n].  shows the effect of cybercrime that leads to payment fraud. As mentioned, cybersecurity awareness plays a vital role in fighting against cybercriminals. Thus, in realizing cybersecurity awareness, the following should be considered: (a) determining the various security topics and programs available for cybersecurity training, (b) investigating common mistakes in human behavior, and (c) determining the methods by which cybercriminals act. We are working to address these problems and use these solutions to protect individuals from cybercrimes.\nMoreover, there is a need for robust and efficient solutions, such as the advanced system model that can assess and increase the users\u2019 cybersecurity awareness levels. The system should be secured. Thus, we propose a blockchain-enabled approach that consists of several program modules to increase the cybersecurity awareness levels of users."
