        "original_content": "In the aftermath of digital heists, legal relief remains scarce for victims suing cryptocurrency platforms and mobile service providers accused of inadequately safeguarding users\u2019 assets, including crypto wallets and phone numbers. \nDespite rising cybercrime, complaints blaming crypto theft on lax company security fell to a mere 11 cases in 2023 after peaking at 20 new cases a year earlier, according to an analysis of Bloomberg Law\u2019s docket data. The primary reason for victims\u2019 inability to find relief in court is private arbitration provisions saving the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and mobile providers from litigation, dockets show. \nArbitration and other contractual protections like liability caps are shielding these popular targets of crypto theft hacks\u2014cryptocurrency exchanges including \nCoinbase Global Inc.\n and some of the country\u2019s largest cellular operators \u2014from costly legal decisions. Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to gain traction with crypto-theft lawsuits points to a concerted and successful legal strategy adopted by the cryptocurrency industry in response to an onslaught of hacks and lawsuits in prior years, said \nScott Wortman\n, a partner specializing in financial services defense litigation at Blank Rome LLP. \n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more legal sophistication amongst the cryptocurrency industry, and we typically see that with new and emerging technologies,\u201d Wortman said. \u201cThe other aspect besides enforcing arbitration is putting caps on liability,\u201d because until a few years ago crypto companies hadn\u2019t established contractual protections \u201cthat were sophisticated enough to enforce.\u201d\nCrypto has been an especially popular financial target for hackers and ransomware attacks because it\u2019s harder to trace than more traditional financial transactions using US currency. The diminishing lawsuits seeking monetary recovery dovetail with recent \nresearch\n revealing that while hacking incidents rose in 2023, the total value stolen from crypto exchanges fell by more than half in a year, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Of the new lawsuits filed in 2022, only one remains active while seven were dismissed and eight pushed into arbitration.\nTwo of the suits filed last year were voluntarily dismissed but the other nine remain active. More than half allege a customer\u2019s cryptocurrency was stolen via a scam called SIM swapping in which hackers overtake an individual\u2019s phone number and use it to log into their accounts.\n\u201cPotentially you\u2019re seeing an over-concentration in the publicly-filed litigation because remember, you\u2019re just seeing publicly-filed litigation on the SIM-swap, because there\u2019s somebody else to sue,\u201d said \nBrenda Sharton\n, the global chair of Dechert LLP\u2019s cybersecurity practice. That makes mobile service companies \u201cattractive targets,\u201d she added.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s phishing, who are you going to sue?\u201d she said.\nLegal Lessons \nOne possible explanation for the sudden drop-off may be that the plaintiffs\u2019 bar hasn\u2019t found crypto cases profitable, said \nSterling Miller\n, CEO and senior counsel at Hilgers Graben PLLC. \nMost crypto theft litigation has been filed by individual victims, with few class actions filed over elaborate, targeted hacking campaigns. Most of the complaints end up dismissed or sent to private arbitration before reaching monetary settlement. Juries are almost never involved, according to Bloomberg Law\u2019s data. \nIn-house counsel should take note of the resolved litigation as examples of successful methods for killing cases and avoiding litigation on crypto theft, Miller said. General counsel should ensure their \u201cterms and conditions have an arbitration provision and a no class action provision,\u201d because courts generally uphold those, he said.\nOne of the few still-active class actions involves \nclaims\n that Atomic Wallet\u2019s lax cybersecurity protections enabled North Korean cybercriminals to steal over $100 million in funds from approximately 5,500 user wallets. \nAvoiding lawsuits via arbitration also helps companies avoid public disclosures, from unwanted media attention to court records\u2014companies facing certified class actions must notify state and federal regulators. These disclosures open \u201cdoors you want to remain closed no matter what,\u201d Wortman said, who also advises clients on financial services regulation. \nWortman said one open question in case law is whether cryptocurrency qualifies as funds under the 1978 Electronic Funds Transfer Act, as he said district courts have issued diverging rulings in cases alleging violations of the law. \nCyber Defenses\nCrypto theft peaked in 2022 as hackers stole an aggregate of $3.7 billion in funds, Chainalysis\u2019 report found. In one of the year\u2019s largest crypto cybersecurity incidents, hackers \nswiped approximately $600 million\n from gaming blockchain company Ronin. \n\u201cMost of the time these are common law claims of negligence, and these are very sophisticated threat actors,\u201d Sharton said. \u201cSo you can have a state-of-the-art program and still get hacked.\u201d\n Despite crypto hacks intensifying in 2023, just $1.7 billion in funds was stolen, according to Chainalysis. This was likely due to a combination of bolstered platform security and the decreased value of widely-used tokens such as Bitcoin that year, Wortman said. \n\u201cThe high profile compromises of exchanges and wallets brought several companies down due to lack of trust,\u201d Ken Westin the field chief information security officer at cyber threat detection firm, Panther Labs, said in an email.\n\u201cThere has been a lot more focus on securing crypto wallets after some of the large compromises of accounts,\u201d he said."
