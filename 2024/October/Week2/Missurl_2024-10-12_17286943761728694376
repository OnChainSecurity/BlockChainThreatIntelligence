        "original_content": " Cryptocurrency scams take many forms. Just as financial criminals will try to steal money from your bank account or put fraudulent charges on your credit card, crypto scammers will do anything to take your crypto. To protect your crypto assets, it helps to know when and how you\u2019re being targeted and what you can do if you suspect that a cryptocurrency or any communications related to it are a scam.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nCrypto scams often aim to gain private information, such as security codes, or to trick a person into sending cryptocurrency to a digital wallet that may be compromised.\n\n\nExamples of scams are giveaways, hustles involving new romance, phishing, extortion emails, fake company alerts, blackmail, \"rug pulls,\" and may involve fake mining apps or networks.\n\n\nSigns of crypto scams include poorly written white papers, excessive marketing pushes, and get-rich-quick claims.\n\n\nRegulatory agencies, such as your \nstate's consumer protection office\n or the \nConsumer Protection Bureau\n, are the best places to contact if you suspect you've been the victim of a scam.\n\n\nAlways do your research to ensure the \ncrypto software wallet\n, \ncrypto exchange\n, or app is trustworthy before signing up for it.\n\n\n\n\n \n Types of Cryptocurrency Scams \n \n\n\n Generally speaking, \ncryptocurrency\n scams fall into two categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiatives aiming to obtain access to a target\u2019s \ndigital wallet\n or authentication credentials. This means scammers try to get information that gives them access to a digital wallet or other types of private information, such as security codes. In some cases, it can include access to physical hardware, such as a computer or smartphone.\n\n\nSchemes that involve transferring your cryptocurrency directly to a scammer, prompted by impersonation, \nfraudulent investment\n or business opportunities, or other malicious means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Social Engineering Fraud \n \n\n\n For \nsocial engineering\n scams, the perpetrators use psychological manipulation and deceit to gain control of vital information relating to user accounts. Successful scammers condition people to think they are dealing with a trusted entity, such as a government agency, a well-known business, tech support, a community member, a work colleague, or a friend.\n\n\n\n Scammers will take as much time as necessary to gain the trust of a potential victim. Then, they may eventually ask the individual to reveal \nprivate keys\n or send money to their digital wallet. When one of these \"trusted\" entities demands cryptocurrency for any reason, it is a sign that something's amiss.\n\n\n\nTake the Next Step to Invest\n\n\n Advertiser Disclosure\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n \n Frauds Promising Romance \n \n\n\n Scammers often use dating websites to make unsuspecting individuals believe they are in a real relationship, whether a new or long-term one. Once the individual trusts the scammer, conversations often shift to supposedly lucrative cryptocurrency opportunities and the eventual transfer of either coins or account authentication credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n The FBI found that in 2022, over $735.8 million was lost in romance scams, and in 2023, more than $652.5 million was stolen.\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Imposter and Giveaway Scams \n \n\n\n Moving down the sphere of influence, scammers also try to pose as celebrities, businesspeople, or cryptocurrency \ninfluencers\n. To capture the attention of potential targets, many scammers promise to match or multiply the cryptocurrency sent to them in what is known as a \"giveaway scam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Well-crafted messaging from what often looks like an existing \nsocial media\n account can create and spark a sense of validity and urgency. This \nmythical\n \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity can lead people to transfer funds quickly in hopes of receiving an instant return. Impersonators claiming to be from the \ncryptocurrency \nexchange's support or security teams also contact crypto owners to trick them out of funds.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Phishing \n \n\n\n Within the cryptocurrency industry, \nphishing\n scams target people using crypto software wallets. Specifically, scammers need a crypto wallet's private keys\u2014a string of letters and numbers that act like a password and are required to access cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhishing scams are the most common attacks on consumers. According to the FBI, more than 300,000 people fell victim to phishing scams in 2022 and 298,000 in 2023. Collectively, those people turned over $52.1 million to scammers in 2022 and more than $18.7 million in 2023.\n1\n2\n\n\n Their method follows the playbook of many standard scams: They send an email with links that lead holders to a specially created website and ask them to enter private keys. Once the hackers have this information, they steal the victim's cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Blackmail and Extortion Schemes \n \n\n\n Blackmail is another popular social engineering method scammers use. Blackmailers make the claim to potential victims that they have a record of adult websites or other illicit web pages the user frequents. The blackmailers then threaten to expose the individuals unless they share their private keys or cryptocurrency with them. Such cases represent a criminal \nextortion\n attempt and should be reported to a law enforcement agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Fraud Involving Investment or Business Opportunities \n \n\n\n The adage \"if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is\" is one to remember for anyone venturing into investing in general. This is especially true for cryptocurrencies. Countless profit-seeking speculators turn to misleading websites offering \"guaranteed returns\" or other setups for which investors must invest large sums of money for even larger \"guaranteed\" returns. Unfortunately, these bogus guarantees often lead to financial disaster when individuals find they can't get their money back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, fraud may not be obvious until you conduct your due diligence or think critically about an opportunity. Many investors fell victim to FTX, a popular cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as SBF. SBF was found guilty of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to commit commodities fraud. He and his staff at FTX used billions of customer funds to live a lavish lifestyle and defraud investors.\n4\n\n\n \n New Crypto-Based Opportunities: ICOs and NFTs \n \n\n\n Crypto-based investments, such as \ninitial coin offerings (ICOs)\n and \nnon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n, provide even more avenues for scammers to access your money. Remember that although \ncrypto-based investments\n or business opportunities may sound lucrative, they don\u2019t always reflect reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n For example, some scammers create fake websites for ICOs and instruct users to deposit cryptocurrency into a compromised digital wallet. In other instances, the ICO itself may be at fault. Founders could distribute unregulated tokens or mislead investors about their products through false advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Rug Pulls \n \n\n\n A so-called rug pull occurs when project members raise capital or crypto to fund a project and then suddenly remove all the liquidity\u2014and they themselves disappear and become unreachable. Scammers abandon the project, and investors lose all they have contributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Cloud Mining \n \n\n\n Platforms market to retail buyers and investors to get them to contribute upfront capital to secure an ongoing stream of \nmining\n power and rewards. These platforms don't own the \nhash rate \nthey claim to and don't deliver the rewards after receiving your down payment. While \ncloud mining \nisn't always a scam, to keep your money, you must conduct rigorous due diligence on the platform before investing.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n How to Spot Cryptocurrency Scams \n \n\n\n Cryptocurrency scams are easy to spot when you know what to look for. Legitimate cryptocurrencies have readily available disclosure, with detailed information about the \nblockchain\n and associated tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Read the White Paper \n \n\n\n Cryptocurrencies go through a development process. Before this process, there is generally a document published, called a \nwhite paper\n, for the public to read. If it's a legitimate white paper, it clearly describes the protocols and blockchain, outlines the formulas, and explains how the entire network functions. Fake cryptocurrencies don't produce thoroughly written and researched white papers. The fakes are poorly written, with figures that don't add up.\n\n\n\n\n\n If the whitepaper reads like a pitchbook and outlines how the funds will be used in a project, it is likely a scam or an ICO that should be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If it isn't registered, it's best to ignore it and move on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, read the white papers of well-known cryptocurrencies, such as \nEthereum\n and \nBitcoin\n.\n\n\n \n Identify Team Members \n \n\n\n White papers should always spotlight the members and developers behind the cryptocurrency. There are cases in which an \nopen-source\n crypto project might not have named developers, which is typical for open-source projects. Still, you can view most coding, comments, and discussions on GitHub or GitLab. Some projects use forums and applications, like Discord or Slack, for discussion. If you can't find any of these elements, and the white paper is rife with errors, stand down\u2014it's likely a scam.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Beware of \"Free\" Items \n \n\n\n Many cryptocurrency scams offer free coins or promise to \u201cdrop\u201d coins into your wallet. Remind yourself that nothing is ever free, especially money and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Scrutinize the Marketing \n \n\n\n Legitimate blockchains and cryptocurrency projects tend to have humble beginnings and don't have the money to advertise and market themselves. Additionally, they won't post on social media pumping themselves up as the next best crypto\u2014they'll talk about the legitimate issues they are trying to solve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost valid cryptocurrency developers do not market the project's coin. Instead, they post documentation that outlines the cryptocurrency's purpose. If it appears to lack a purpose, it's likely (but not always) a scam. It might be a cryptocurrency just to be a cryptocurrency, similar to \nDogecoin\n, which has no official purpose and was advertised as such.\n\n\n You might see cryptocurrency updates about blockchain developments or new security measures taken, but you should be wary of updates like \"millions raised\" or communications that appear to be more about money than about advances in the technology behind the crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n Legitimate businesses exist that use blockchain technology to provide services. They might have tokens used within their blockchains to pay transaction fees, but the advertising and marketing should appear professional-looking. Scammers also spend on \ncelebrity endorsements\n and appearances and have all the information readily available on their websites. Legitimate businesses won't ask everyone to buy their crypto; they will advertise their blockchain-based services.\n\n\n\n\n\n Where there is a lot of hype, there is usually something to be cautious of.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n How to Avoid Scams \n \n\n\n There are several actions you can take to steer clear of being scammed. Never click on links, dial a phone number, contact someone who reaches out about financial issues, or send them money. Also:\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIgnore requests to give out your private cryptocurrency keys. Those keys control your crypto and wallet access, and no one needs them for a legitimate cryptocurrency transaction.\nShun enterprises that promise you'll make lots of money.\nDon't engage with investment managers who contact you and say they can grow your money quickly.\nBe wary of \"celebrities\" contacting you. A real celebrity won't reach out to you about buying cryptocurrency.\nMeet in person any romantic interests you are connected with on an online dating website or app. Don't give them money.\nIgnore text messages and emails from well-known or new companies saying your account is frozen or that they are worried about it and can help you \"unfreeze\" it.\nContact a regulatory agency if you receive an email, text, or social media message claiming to be from a government, law enforcement agency, bank, financial institution, or utility company stating that your accounts or assets are frozen. Don't answer the initial correspondence through their means of communication. Instead, get details on how to connect from an agency's official website.\nIgnore job listings for cash-to-crypto converter or crypto miner openings.\nScrutinize claims about explicit material a scammer may say they have about you that they threaten to post unless you send cryptocurrency. This is blackmail. Report it.\nDon't accept \"free\" money or crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your state might have a webpage that lists currency cryptocurrency scams. For example, the State of California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation has a \nfantastic list of complaints\n it has received that can raise your awareness. You can find your state's consumer protection offices by visiting USA.gov's state \nconsumer protection office search page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n How to Report Scams \n \n\n\n Several organizations can help you if you\u2019re a victim of a cryptocurrency scam or suspect one. Use their online complaint forms to seek help:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You can also directly contact the crypto exchange you use. Find out if they offer fraud prevention or have other measures to protect your crypto assets and money.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow Can You Tell If Someone Is a Crypto Scammer?\n\n\nLegitimate businesses will not correspond with you via social networks or text messages. They also will not ask you for your private keys to help you with an action. The best way to avoid a crypto scammer is to be wary of any communications sent your way and conduct research on every project to learn about the team behind it. If someone is attempting to scam you, it is likely they have tried it with others also. Search for the cryptocurrency using the word \"scam\" and see what you find. Visit official consumer protection sites like the FTC, FBI, and SEC. The State of California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation has an \nexcellent compilation of scam attempt\ns with descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow Do Crypto Scams Work?\n\n\nThere are many ways these scams work, but most involve getting you to give your cryptocurrency private keys to someone in exchange for something else, like good returns or in an attempt to blackmail you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat Are the Red Flags of Cryptocurrency Scams?\n\n\nSome signs include pressure to not miss an opportunity, contacting you and asking for your private keys, or building a relationship with you before asking for cryptocurrency to help them. There are many scams, and more are being created\u2014they are becoming increasingly sophisticated and realistic. Make sure to keep yourself up-to-date on all of the current scam tactics being used by reading about them on official channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n The Bottom Line \n \n\n\n For many people, the mad rush into cryptocurrencies has evoked a sense of the Wild West or Gold Rush eras, when limitless possibilities for enriching themselves were possible. Yet, anyone who's studied these periods knows that many speculators lost it all while trying to get rich.\n\n\n\n\n\n As the crypto ecosystem gains scale and complexity, it will undoubtedly remain a focal point for scammers. Crypto scams generally fall into two categories: socially engineered initiatives to obtain account or security information, and efforts to persuade a target to send cryptocurrency to a compromised digital wallet. By understanding the common ways that scammers try to steal your information (and ultimately your money), you can know how to spot a crypto-related scam early and prevent it from happening to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
