        "original_content": "\n\nJust as things seemed to be settling down post-pandemic, 2023 turned out to be a year of global political upheaval, conflict and climate catastrophe. Recession impacts and \nrising prices for business basics like electricity\n have seen \nclosures rise and start-ups decline\n. Congratulations are in order if your organization still has its head above water.\n\n\nThe last thing any business needs in 2024 is a highly damaging and costly cyberattack or data leak. \nIBM\u2019s 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report\n found, \u201cThe average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2023 of 4.45 million US dollars,\u201d having increased over 15 percent in the past three years.\n\n\nKeeping track of how cyberthreats are changing and adjusting your cybersecurity strategy and resourcing accordingly will help businesses avoid the punishing cost of a breach. Here are some of the changing and new threats Kaspersky researchers think you should prepare for in 2024.\n\n\nAI-related threats\n\n\nAI and other interconnected technologies \u2013 think augmented reality (AR,) 6G, data spaces and more \u2013 made a huge splash for business in 2023, and we\u2019ll soon be releasing some exciting new research about the impact of their widespread adoption. On top of that, we think these changes will loom large for AI in 2024:\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AI tools will make scams more convincing\n\n\nScammers use many techniques to get past our defenses. AI tools can now effortlessly create stunning images, even designing whole landing pages. Malicious actors will, of course, use these to craft more convincing materials for fraud, like fake marketing emails and login screens. Expect fraud-related cyberthreats to increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen AI can make or break your business, how do you harness its power while staying within ethical boundaries?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do about it:\n Improve your employee cybersecurity awareness education to help them become more vigilant to potentially fraudulent content. Use robust antivirus software to block scam emails and warn about suspicious websites.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerns about pre-trained AI models will rise\n\n\nAs more organizations start using AI chatbots and large language models (LLMs) to help professionals with their work, privacy and security concerns around the data fueling these models will rise, especially in large businesses that deal with a lot of information. And for good reason \u2013 training common LLMs often relies on public datasets containing sensitive information, raising uncertainty about whether corporate data fed into these models will stay confidential or be used to train the model further.\n\n\nWhat to do about it: \nBusinesses must adopt policies limiting how employees can use AI products and educate staff about these policies to reduce the risk of data leaks. They may also adopt Private Large Language Models (PLLMs) \u2013 these models are trained only with datasets owned by the organization using them.\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AI regulation will ramp up\n\n\nMore countries and international organizations will join efforts to regulate AI in the coming year, especially African and Asian nations that are engaged in discussions but haven\u2019t yet begun regulating AI domestically. Those already involved will expand regulation, adopting more specific rules, for example, around creating training datasets and using personal data.\n\n\nWith their experience developing and using AI, businesses can offer invaluable insight for discussions on AI regulation. Policymakers worldwide are actively seeking input from businesses, academia and the public on shaping AI governance.\n\n\nIn 2023, the \nBletchley Declaration\n promoted greater uniformity in AI regulation. But with rising geopolitical tensions, cooperation between countries may reduce, derailing efforts to keep it consistent.\n\n\nWhat to do about it: \nEnsure your business is staying ahead of developments in regulation and planning for how it will comply. Take opportunities to get involved in developing AI regulation.\n\n\nMore 2024 AI security predictions from Kaspersky researchers\n\n\nFinancial services threats\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fraudsters will target direct payment systems\n\n\nCybercriminals will exploit increasingly popular direct payment systems like Brazil\u2019s \nPix\n, the US\u2019s \nFedNow\n and India\u2019s \nUPI\n for fraud. We\u2019ll also see more \nclipboard malware\n \u2013 malware that steals data users copy to their clipboard \u2013 designed to attack new direct payment systems. \nMobile banking trojans\n will increasingly exploit these systems as a quick and efficient means of cashing out ill-gotten gains.\n\n\nWhat to do about it: \nDirect payment systems have enormous benefits for business but must be appropriately secured. Businesses can also educate customers to help reduce their likelihood of accidentally downloading clipboard malware or mobile banking trojans \u2013 often disguised as legitimate apps in trusted app stores.\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mobile Automated Transfer Systems (ATS) will spread worldwide\n\n\nMobile Automated Transfer System (ATS)\n attacks are fairly new and involve banking malware making fraudulent transactions when the user logs in to their banking app. Mobile ATS has only been seen in Brazilian malware types but could go global in 2024.\n\n\nWhat to do about it: \nThose who make banking apps must ensure their security is capable of defending against Mobile ATS.\n\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brazilian banking trojans will also keep spreading\n\n\nCybercrime originating from Brazil is well-known to be growing. As many Eastern European cybercriminals have shifted focus to ransomware, Brazilian banking trojans will fill the void left by desktop banking trojans. \nTrojan Grandoreiro has already targeted more than 900 banks in 40 countries\n.\n\n\nGrandoreiro attacks start with a malicious link in a phishing email, including fake shared documents, utility bills and tax forms. It then harvests data using keyloggers, screen-grabbers or overlays on online banking login pages.\n\n\nWhat to do about it: \nDespite the growing sophistication, cybersecurity awareness education still helps employees and customers avoid falling prey to phishing. Businesses must also make sure users feel comfortable reporting their suspicions.\n\n\nMore financial services cybersecurity predictions for 2024\n\n\nAdvanced persistent threats\n\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creative exploits of wearables and smart devices will grow\n\n\nIn 2023, Kaspersky discovered \nOperation Triangulation\n \u2013 a stealthy new espionage campaign targeting Apple devices. Kaspersky\u2019s investigation found five vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s operating systems that affect everything Apple \u2013 from smartphones to wearable devices to smart home gadgets like Apple TV and Apple Watch.\n\n\nIn 2024, we\u2019ll see more advanced attacks on consumer devices and smart home technology, including other operating systems.\n\n\nDevices like smart home cameras and connected car systems are attractive for threat actors because of their surveillance potential and tendency to run on outdated software, which makes them easier to attack.\n\n\nWhat to do about it: \nSecure your business Internet of Things (IoT) devices and ensure that if they don\u2019t need to connect to the internet, they don\u2019t.\n\n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supply chain attacks-as-a-service: Bulk-buying access\n\n\nThere is a growing trend of \nattacking businesses through their suppliers\n. Small and medium companies that may lack advanced protection become gateways for hackers to access the data and infrastructure of big players. 2022 and 2023 saw \nbreaches through identity management company Okta\n, which serves over 18,000 customers worldwide.\n\n\nWhat to do about it:\n Supply chain attacks expert Eliza-May Austin has great advice on preventing supply chain attacks in this Tomorrow Unlocked video:\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More attacks on Managed File Transfer systems\n\n\nManaged File Transfer (MFT) systems that let businesses securely exchange sensitive information with partners have become a cornerstone of organizational efficiency. But housing confidential information like intellectual property, financial records and customer data puts them in the crosshairs of cyber adversaries.\n\n\nMFT systems\u2019 intricate architecture and integration into business networks also means potential security weaknesses. In 2023, MFT system incidents involving \nMOVEit\n and \nGoAnywhere\n confirmed this.\n\n\nWhat to do about it:\n Undertake comprehensive reviews of your MFT solutions to identify and reduce security weaknesses. Implement robust Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, encrypt sensitive data and build a \ncybersecurity awareness culture\n among employees.\n\n\nMore advanced persistent threat predictions for 2024\n\n\nWith attention to where threats will likely grow, the year ahead need not be daunting for business. From getting ahead of AI regulation to improved cybersecurity awareness education, organizations of all sizes can stay secure even as threats grow.\n\n\n\n"
