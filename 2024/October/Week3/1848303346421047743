        "original_content": "In light of the recent incident at Radiant and the clear challenges of\nverifying multisig transactions on a Ledger device, I've built a simple Bash\nscript designed to simplify the process. This script generates the domain,\nmessage, and Safe transaction hashes, making it easier to cross-check them\nwith the values displayed on your Ledger hardware wallet. All you need to\nprovide are the network name, multisig address, and transaction nonce. It\nsupports all Safe networks, and I hope it will serve as a useful tool to\ntemporarily ease the burden of blind signing verification for multisig\ntransactions. Eventually, make sure to check out the trust assumptions laid\nout in the README for this script.
