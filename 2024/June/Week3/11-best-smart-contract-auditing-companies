        "original_content": "11 Best Smart Contract Auditing CompaniesWith regular exploits in the highly competitive world of DeFi, smart contract audits are a critical component of crypto security as most protocols run on an intricate set of smart contracts. In a smart contract audit, third-party entities will review the code, testing it to check for any security vulnerabilities or other potential issues. The auditor will then share a report that covers detected issues and their level of severity. \n\nWhy is Smart Contract Auditing Important?\nA good smart contract audit accomplishes two key objectives: security and trust.\n\nQuality smart contract assurance helps identify potential issues, and ensures that the protocol is taking the necessary steps to address any bugs or flaws that could put its users\u2019 funds at risk. Although there are no guarantees that a protocol will be secure after an audit, a good smart contract auditor can still perform comprehensive reviews to uncover potential issues, potentially preventing catastrophic vulnerabilities after launch. \n\n\nSecondly, a good audit helps the project gain a certain level of confidence and trust with the crypto community, as well as with potential VC investors, that a baseline level of security has been established. This is important not just for new projects which are launching into the market, but also for existing projects deploying a major upgrade. Instead of \"testing in prod\", having an audit conducted by a third-party auditor is fast becoming standard practice before any major changes to smart contracts are deployed to production. In addition, there is now cer.live which actively tracks and rates the cybersecurity of cryptos and platforms, and at CoinGecko we incorporate these ratings into our own TrustScore.\n\nFinally, beyond just smart contract audits, certain security firms have also branched out into offering other cybersecurity services such as penetration testing, running bug bounty programs, vulnerability assessments, and threat modeling. All these are additional services a project can engage in should they require further assistance or support. \n\nIf you\u2019re on a project looking for a good auditor, below are some of the factors to consider, and we also list down some of the most reputable firms out there. \n\nHow to Choose a Smart Contract Auditor\nOne of the first steps in finding the right smart contract auditor is to check the portfolios of projects/platforms they have audited in the past. Doing so will allow you to see the number of audits they have worked on, and perhaps more importantly if any of the projects/platforms they have worked on have been exploited. Also, the size/popularity of the projects they have audited will help determine whether the auditor is worth hiring as larger projects will tend to attract more attention from hackers. \n\nWhile most auditors will offer Ethereum contract audits, only some will have the expertise to audit projects on altchains such as Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, and BNB. This is because even EVM-compatible chains have different underlying architectures, not to mention certain altchains such as Solana and NEAR use a completely different programming language altogether, e.g. Rust. Different firms are going to have different areas of expertise in auditing protocols built on different blockchains, so it would be wise to assess their level of competency before engaging them for an audit. At a minimum, you should look at an audit firm\u2019s portfolio to see if it has conducted any past audits on your chain of choice. For example, If you are opting for a Solana-based Contract Audit, check the company's past audits for Solana-based projects.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind when looking at past audit reports is the methodology and approach taken by the audit firm. In many instances, the scope of an audit varies across different projects, and audit firms undertake jobs of varying complexity based on their agreement with their clients. Obviously a more detailed and thorough audit the better, but it also means a longer time for completion and more costs for the project. A thorough audit also takes into account the quality of the code, as while it may not be an issue now, poorly-written code could cause problems in the future when the protocol needs to be upgraded. \n\nFinally, the quality of audit reports is another factor to look for in a good auditor. A good report should include a detailed description of all the issues that were found during the course of the investigation. It\u2019s also very important to note if the findings of the audit have been addressed by the project. While you would expect a smart contract audit report to be quite technical, having a report which is well structured, and written concisely in a manner understandable by most people is also a good sign to look out for.\n\nHacken\n# of projects onboarded: 700+\n\nTotal MCAP of portfolio: $100B+\n\nMajor clients: Avalanche, VeChain, Huobi, Kyber, The Sandbox, Kucoin, WhiteBit\n\nChains supported: Ethereum, EVM chains, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, NEAR, Fantom, BNB\n\n# of audited projects on Rektboard: 2\n\nTotal amount rekt: $8.5M\n\nHacken is a leading cybersecurity consulting company founded by security specialists and white hat hackers with a focus on blockchain security.

Instead, they should be viewed as part of a process that involves continuous improvement. Once a project has had an audit, developers should still put in the legwork to ensure that the findings are addressed, and they put in the right security practices to ensure that the possibility of future vulnerabilities is minimized. Before smart contracts can be trusted by users, the developers still need to ensure that they perform as intended. This also means carrying out security tests that are specific to the protocol.\n\nHaving an active Bug Bounty program after a security audit is also important. Rather than relying on a single security professional, Bug Bounty programs attract security experts around the globe with diverse backgrounds and varying degrees of expertise to improve the underlying security. Incentivizing a global network of experts to comb through your smart contracts for bugs ensures that all assets in scope are reviewed thoroughly.\n\nOverall, having a security audit is still certainly very helpful to weed out any potential issues and help a project gain a certain level of confidence, and it is always recommended for users to select an auditor with a good reputation and proven track record.\n"
