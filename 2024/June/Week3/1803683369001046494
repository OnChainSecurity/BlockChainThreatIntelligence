Kraken claimed that Certik embezzled $3 million after reporting the\nvulnerability. Certik countered that Kraken's security team demanded the\nreturn of an unreasonable amount of cryptocurrency after fixing the issue,\naccusing Kraken of violating white hat activity ethics. Some communities\nallege that Certik transferred the funds to Tornado Cash, but this hasn't been\nconfirmed. Certik attempted to return the funds but wasn't provided with a\nreturn address or method by Kraken.\n[#Bitcoinworld]"
