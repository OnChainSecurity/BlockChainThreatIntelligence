Last year, crypto criminals stole a total of $1.7 billion, but 2024 is on track to eclipse that figure.\nHackers have targeted crypto users\u2019 private keys and seed phrases, smart contracts, and flash loans. \"Once a crypto wallet is compromised, it is extremely hard to retrieve funds stolen,\" Vatom CEO Eric Pulier told TheStreet Crypto.\nHackers use methods like installing malware, gaining access to private keys or user credentials, and placing skimming devices on Bitcoin ATMs. Some sophisticated hackers use remote access Trojans to manipulate transactions and steal funds.\nDespite the high degree of theft, this year\u2019s stolen crypto has not yet surpassed the $2 billion recorded in the first half of 2022. Interestingly, nearly three-quarters of this year\u2019s stolen crypto stemmed from just five incidents, showing that criminals are sweeping up large volumes in fewer attacks.\nA key reason for the surge in Bitcoin theft this year is Bitcoin's elevated price levels since the January debut of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin ascended to new heights this year, exceeding $73,000 this spring.\n#CryptoTheft #Blockchain #Bitcoin #CyberSecurity #CryptoNews\nasdsfghjklk;'"
