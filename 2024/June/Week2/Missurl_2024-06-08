USDC is a tokenized U.S. dollar, with the value of one USDC coin pegged as close to the value of one U.S. dollar as it can get. The value of USDC is designed to remain stable, making USDC a stablecoin.\n\nStablecoins are commonly backed by reserve assets like dollars or euros to achieve price stability. The price stability of USDC contrasts sharply with the notorious price fluctuations of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nKeep reading to understand more about USDC, including how it works and the various use cases for the digital currency.Key Takeaways\nUSD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is backed by U.S. dollars and U.S. Treasury instruments.\nThe USDC Circle Reserve Fund is held at The Bank of New York Mellon and is managed by BlackRock.\nCash is held in segregated accounts with U.S.-regulated financial institutions.\nThe U.S. government does not issue USDC.\nUnderstanding USD Coin (USDC)\nUSD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency backed by U.S. dollars or dollar-denominated assets like U.S. Treasury securities. USDC's cash assets are held in segregated accounts with regulated U.S. financial institutions and its reserve portfolio is held at the Bank of New York Mellon.\n\nCircle, the company behind USDC, maintains the 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar by holding an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to the amount of USDC circulation. So, if you initiate a transaction to buy one USD Coin using $1, then that dollar is deposited and stored, and you hold 1 USDC. If you sell 1 USDC in exchange for $1, the USDC is burned (sent to a wallet with no access keys) when the fiat money is transferred back to your bank account.\n1\n\nUSDC is compatible with several blockchains, including:\n2USD Coin was managed by Centre, a consortium co-founded by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN), and Circle, a financial technology company. This partnership was dissolved and Circle became the sole responsible party.\n4\nCircle. \"Ushering in the Next Chapter for USDC.\"\n\n The company aims to change the global financial landscape by connecting every person, merchant, financial service, and currency worldwide.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of USD Coin\nPros\nLow price volatility\n\nFully backed by U.S.-regulated reserve assets\n\nCan be used as a hedge against inflation\n\nCons\nNo price appreciation\n\nNot immune to U.S. dollar price inflation\n\nUse Cases for USD Coin\nAs a price-stable digital asset, USDC can be used in several ways:\n\nHedge against volatility: Investors exposed to other cryptocurrencies can reduce their portfolios' volatility by strategically buying a stablecoin like USDC. Owning USDC during periods of significant market volatility can help to stabilize a portfolio's value.\nPricing in fiat money: Digital assets listed on cryptocurrency exchanges can be priced in fiat money using a stablecoin like USDC.\nStable price-pegging: The price stability of USDC enables the stablecoin to represent equity ownership or fund investments. USDC can also be used to represent liabilities or debt.\nRemittances: USDC can be used to send funds across borders. Recipients can store USDC without using a bank account or being concerned about price volatility.\nU.S. dollar exposure: Non-U.S. investors wishing to gain exposure to the U.S. dollar can add USDC to their cryptocurrency investment portfolios.\nHedge against inflation: Non-U.S. investors concerned about inflation of their local currency can hold a stablecoin like USDC to help protect the value of their money.\nGlobal crowdfunding: Startup companies and nonprofit organizations can raise money from investors and donors worldwide by soliciting digital currency. Raising funds in the form of a stablecoin like USDC ensures that the value of the money raised does not fluctuate over time.\nBlockchain interconnection: Since USDC is compatible with several autonomous blockchains, USDC can be a way to integrate payment systems and applications across blockchains.\nIs USD Coin a Good Investment?\nUSD Coin is not designed to be an investment; it is designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nIs USDC Always $1?\nUSDC maintains a price $1 price by holding fiat currency equal to the amount of circulating USDC. Its price might vary in $0.0001 increments, but for the most part it is pegged.\n\nHow Much Is a USD Coin Worth?\nA USD Coin is usually worth slightly more than $1 (such as $1.0001 or $1.0003), but for the most part, it has been stable since mid-2020.\n5\n\nThe Bottom Line\nUSD Coin is a stablecoin backed by a reserve of U.S. fiat currency. For each USDC in circulation, there is one dollar held in reserve. However, USDC's price fluctuates many times throughout the day (often by the minute), as much as $0.0006. This isn't much compared to other cryptocurrencies, but it demonstrates that while the coin is relatively stable, it isn't a 1:1 peg 100% of the time.\n5\n\nThe coin is also susceptible to external influences-when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, it became apparent that about 8% of USDC reserves were held at the bank, causing the coin to lose its peg.\n6\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
