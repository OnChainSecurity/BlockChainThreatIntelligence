However, what many don\u2019t know is that blockchain can also be used for business purposes to send protected, more secure communications that are safer than traditional networks. So how does cybersecurity play a role in current blockchain technology?\n\nCybercriminals are increasing the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks by pooling their knowledge and leveraging new technologies. Their use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and botnets help them perpetrate cybercrime more efficiently, causing more profound and widespread damage. Traditional solutions alone are often insufficient to meet modern cybersecurity challenges. So we must explore other approaches for improving information security, including blockchain technology.\n\nIn addition, businesses have faced new challenges, such as mitigating vulnerabilities when more staff work remotely, using personal devices and new collaborative software to connect and transmit data to business networks.\n\nThis post helps organizations manage the three steps required to drive successful, secure blockchain implementation.\n\nUnderstanding the cybersecurity risks of using blockchain\nEnforcing blockchains\u2019 unique security controls and making the most of their advantages\nImplementing traditional cybersecurity best practices\nWhat is Blockchain?\nThe blockchain, according to IBM, is \"a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\"\n\nIt is a system for tracking anything with value securely, transparently, and cost-efficiently.\n\nThe name blockchain comes from the fact that each transaction is recorded as a \"block\" of data. A block might record one or more data types, such as quantity, price, or location.\n\nThese blocks become a chain as the asset moves from owner to owner. The chain contains the details of each transaction, including their times and sequence.\n\nA blockchain has no single point of failure. Every chain is immutable, so no participant can break a link to insert a block. It\u2019s almost impossible to tamper with one of these cryptographic chains because an agreed consensus mechanism validates the accuracy of every transaction in the chain.\n\nThe owners of assets on blockchains can be practically untraceable, making the technology useful to cybercriminals receiving ransomware payments in cryptocurrency, such as bitcoins. However, businesses and cybersecurity professionals can also use blockchain technology.\n\nWhile blockchain is known for cryptocurrency transactions, such as the Ethereum blockchain platform, blockchain use cases, current and future, vary. Blockchain technology can be advantageous to any use case that would benefit from a secure, transparent, decentralized network, including:\n\nHealthcare\nSupply chain management\nCopyright and royalty protection\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nMessaging\nVoting\nLearn the features of the best attack surface management product for the tech indusry >\n\nBlockchain Types\nWhile a blockchain has inherent security advantages over other networks, cybersecurity benefits, and required solutions differ according to the type of blockchain implemented.\n\nThere are two kinds of blockchain, each necessitating different cybersecurity considerations: public and private.\n\nLearn the features of an ideal risk remediation tool for the tech sector >\n\nPublic Blockchains\nAnyone can join a public blockchain and can do so anonymously. This blockchain ecosystem uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and provide the agreed-upon consensus.\n\nBitcoin remains the most prominent example of a public blockchain. Consensus is achieved via Bitcoin mining - using computer resources to solve cryptographic puzzles to create a proof of work by which to validate each transaction.\n\nA public blockchain does not have many identity and access controls. Authentication and verification are largely carried out through public key encryption.\n\nPrivate Blockchains\nIn contrast, private blockchains rely heavily on identity controls, mostly through digital certificates, using these to make the blockchain private through membership and access privileges. Typically, a private blockchain only allows access to known entities and organizations.\n\nConsensus is achieved on a private blockchain via \"selective endorsement.\" Known users with privileged access and permissions verify transactions and maintain the ledger.\n\nDue to tighter controls, private blockchains can be more likely to satisfy an industry\u2019s regulatory and compliance requirements.\n\nHow Cybersecurity Impacts Blockchain Technology\nCybersecurity is built into blockchain technology because of its inherent nature of being a decentralized system built on principles of security, privacy, and trust.\n\nIn addition to transparency, cost-efficiency, and enhanced security, it is fast. Data on a blockchain network is delivered in real-time, making it useful to anyone who wants to track assets and see transactions end to end, such as payments, orders, and accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that viewing transactions or transmissions may be instant, but due to encryption and serialization processes, each record can be slow to upload compared to typical data networks.\n\nFurthermore, the US\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been working with blockchain technology to create a system that deters and prevents hackers by not only immediately flagging attempts to compromise data but also providing real-time intelligence on the bad actor.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s inherent cybersecurity benefits include the following:\n\nDecentralization\nA blockchain uses a decentralized distributed ledger system rather than relying on a single trusted central authority. With distributed ledger technology (DLT), transactions are recorded across every network node, so cybercriminals face challenges viewing, stealing, or modifying data. It is designed to create trust amongst participants in areas where trust is hard to come by.\n\nCollaborative Consensus\nBlockchains\u2019 collaborative consensus algorithm means that it can monitor the ledger for unusual or malicious activity.\n\nStrong Encryption Practices\nBlockchain networks use encryption and digital signatures effectively, using public key infrastructure for:\n\nValidating configuration modifications\nAuthenticating devices\nSecuring communication\nAn infrastructure of asymmetric cryptographic keys and digital signatures is often core to blockchain technology, providing verification of data ownership and data integrity. In some cases, these elements eliminate the need for passwords, an attack vector through which cybercriminals frequently gain unauthorized access to accounts and networks.\n\nImmutable Records\nNobody can modify a recording on a blockchain ledger. If a record contains an error, it can only be rectified by making another transaction, in which case both transactions will be legible.\n\nIoT Protection\nWith increasing applications in various industries, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are often targeted by cybercriminals due to their inherent vulnerabilities. Blockchain provides additional protection for those using IoT devices.\n\nPreventing DDoS Attacks\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DNS) attack aims to overload a server with requests. It requires a focal point to target, typically an IP address or a small group of IP addresses.\n\nHowever, a blockchain-based domain name system (DNS) can remove that single focal point, neutralizing this cyber threat.\n\nData Privacy\nWhile its transparency is a prime benefit of using blockchain, with everyone able to see immutable transactions, a permissioned blockchain network will allow only trusted networks to view or participate in transactions. This can be achieved with minimal governance.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain lacks the traditional targets sought by cybercriminals, making it more challenging for them to achieve unauthorized access by targeting privacy rules.\n\nSmart Contract Security\nSmart contracts are sets of rules stored on the blockchain that trigger transactions when the conditions are met. This automation makes payments more convenient. Blockchain remains secure because its components are tested for authentication, data security, access control, and business logic validation.\n\nTraditional Cybersecurity Best Practices and Blockchain\nWhen implementing an enterprise-level blockchain network, whether to track currency, orders, accounts, or other digital assets, traditional cybersecurity best practices will enhance blockchain\u2019s inherent security advantages.\n\nRisk Management\nJust as with the implementation of any business system, a thorough risk assessment and subsequent management process are required to ensure data protection and the safety of business systems.\n\nRegulatory Focus\nHeavily-regulated industries aim to protect the public and critical infrastructure with clear guidelines regarding information security. Any blockchain implementation should be carried out with a close eye on regulatory requirements.\n\nDisaster Recovery Plan\nAn organization\u2019s disaster recovery plan must be updated to incorporate its blockchain technology. It must contain the names and contact details of the participants.\n\nFollowing the risk management process, the business\u2019s disaster recovery plan should be updated with scenarios surrounding the risks to the blockchain, including clear descriptions of what people must do in the event of every potential blockchain incident.\n\nMinimum Security Requirements for Blockchain Participants\nAn organization implementing a blockchain solution requires detailed policies on identity verification and access management. This is a critical area for blockchain applications since it\u2019s a potential source of strength and contributes to a firm\u2019s vulnerability.\n\nSecurity Infrastructure\nSince blockchains can be compromised by the theft of keys and unauthorized access to staff devices, the blockchain must be implemented in an environment with an effective cybersecurity structure.\n\nBlockchain Security Considerations\nDespite the inherent privacy and authentication advantages of using blockchains, it\u2019s important to note they are not invulnerable to cyberattacks. Organizations implementing blockchain solutions must use the best cybersecurity practices company-wide and examine blockchain-specific risks and cyber solutions to ensure information security.\n\nThe main cyber risks affecting blockchains are:\n\nTheft of keys\nCode exploitation\nCompromise of physical devices\n51% attacks\nPhysical device theft\nEach of these risks is within the remit of traditional cybersecurity, which is to say that cybersecurity best practices can reduce these risks to information security.\n\nTheft of Keys\nAs secure as a blockchain may be, things can go badly if a cybercriminal manages to steal keys. Various thefts of keys have led to the loss of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2016, $72 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen from Hong Kong\u2019s Bitfinex exchange, taken from users\u2019 segregated wallets. The theft represented about 0.75% of Bitcoin in circulation, causing a 23% slump in the currency\u2019s value.\n\nCybercriminals use phishing - among other methods - to access wallet key owners\u2019 access credentials. They can create emails that look as though they are coming from an authority, demanding access credentials via fake links. If a phishing attempt fools the owner of a key, the cybercriminal can take action that causes harm to that individual and the blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain provides anonymity, security, and convenience, but there is typically no recourse when stolen keys are used to steal currency.\n\nCode Exploitation\nAn exploit is a mechanism by which a hacker takes advantage of a vulnerability. In 2016, a hacker used code exploitation to steal $50 million worth of Ether, the currency for the Ethereum platform.\n\nHackers are adept at intercepting data in transit. One of the problems they must solve is where in the data transmission process they are most likely to succeed. In the case of blockchain transactions, they may be able to steal data on its way to internet service providers (ISPs), extracting confidential data or even currency.\n\nBitcoin mining - the process by which connected computers use their processing power to complete complex cryptographic calculations to verify Bitcoin transactions - is also an attack vector in public blockchain networks.\n\n51% Attack\nA 51% attack involves a hostile blockchain takeover by attaining 51% of the network\u2019s mining power. An individual or group with 51% of a blockchain\u2019s mining power has control of the ledger and can manipulate it.\n\nExploits like this remind organizations that blockchain is not infallible and cybersecurity best practices are required to protect digital assets.\n\nPhysical Device Theft\nHot wallets - virtual currency wallets, including mobile, desktop, and browser-based wallets stored on devices that can connect to the internet - are known to be less secure than cold wallets, which are stored offline.\n\nEven if a blockchain were 100% secure (they\u2019re not), it would still be at risk because access credentials are out in the wild. If a hacker can compromise a physical device, they may be able to make significant fraudulent transactions.\n\nBlockchain Cybersecurity Challenges and Drawbacks\nWhile blockchain technology offers significant benefits, it\u2019s unclear how it will tie in with cybersecurity requirements and business needs.\n\nRegulatory Issues\nOne of the key characteristics of a blockchain is that parties cannot delete or modify transactions. However, this could be problematic for businesses because EU-GDPR, for example, demands that individuals have the right to delete their data, which does not fit the current blockchain model.\n\nWhen implementing a blockchain solution, it\u2019s critical to make meeting regulatory and compliance requirements a primary consideration. The organization must be able to satisfy regulators while using blockchain technology.\n\nScalability\nBecause transactions are implicated in every node, increased transactions can cause issues with block sizes, slowing validation. This is one of the main reasons why larger enterprises or businesses have not adopted blockchain because the high traffic volume may affect data processing speeds. The need for additional verification and security makes blockchain technology slower than traditional systems and networks.\n\nAccess Control\nIn the blockchain model, the owners of digital assets have complete responsibility for them. If users lose private keys, those keys are gone forever. Their digital assets cannot be claimed.\n\nA criminal, cyber or otherwise, who manages to steal cryptographic keys can gain unauthorized access to digital assets, which are then irrecoverable by the true owners.\n\nInsufficient Encryption\nWhile encryption prevents many cyber attacks, it is not 100% effective. Man-in-the-middle attacks - in which cybercriminals intercept transmissions to view, steal, or modify them unknown to the sender or recipient - remain feasible if certain issues are present, including:\n\nWeak keys\nIncorrect keys\nInadequate encryption strength\nErrors in a digital signature or certificate verification\nOverreliance on Blockchain\u2019s Inherent Security Benefits\nSome businesses have been so impressed by the security advantages of using blockchain technology that they have let key cybersecurity best practices slide.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential that companies continue to use traditional cybersecurity best practices to ensure a secure ecosystem in which to implement blockchain technology."
