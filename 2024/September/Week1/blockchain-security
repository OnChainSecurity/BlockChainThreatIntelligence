We\u2019ve seen many instances in the past few years where blockchain solutions were targeted with data theft and cyberattacks - which makes this technology non-immune to cyberattacks even considering its default strong security factor.\n\nIn this complete guide, we will be discussing Blockchain technology, how it works, and how to secure it from cyberattacks with the best secure coding practices and Blockchain penetration testing. \n\nWhat is Blockchain Security?\nBlockchain security is a comprehensive risk management procedure achieved via the implementation of cybersecurity frameworks, security testing methodologies, and secure coding practices to protect a blockchain solution. Blockchain security protects blockchain solutions from online fraud, breaches, and other cyberattacks.\n\nLatest on Blockchain Security\nThe primary benefit of using blockchain technology is that it ensures security in transactions due to its principles of cryptography, decentralization, and consensus. A recent report states that the worldwide blockchain market is expected to be valued at $20 billion in the year 2024.\n\nRight now, 69% of banks are exploring different avenues regarding blockchain tech to make their services safer, consistent, and straightforward. Here are a few examples of recent cyberattacks on blockchain:\n\nA VC firm named Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was a target of a code exploitation attack where it lost more than $60 million worth of Ether cryptocurrency.\nAnother crypto exchange named Bithumb was recently hacked where the data of 30K users were compromised and $870K worth of bitcoin was stolen in a suspected insider job.\nOrganizations today are leveraging Blockchain technology for managing distributed databases, digital transactions, cybersecurity, and healthcare to build blockchain-based solutions for their customers. While the adoption of blockchain has brought many advantages for worldwide organizations, it has also attracted many cybercriminals to penetrate the technology and target organizations with cyberattacks.\n\nWhat is Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a technology that allows users and organizations to store and process data with the structured distributed blocks present in a blockchain network. Each new block stores a transaction or a bundle of transactions that is connected to all the previously available blocks in the form of a cryptographic chain. \n\nHow Blockchain Works?\nBlockchain works as a distributed network that enables decentralization of data which makes it more secure and hard to tamper technology. \n\nIt is a decentralized public ledger network that allows organizations to connect to it via nodes for data storage and processing. The data stored in blocks can be accessed with verification, validation and consensus by the original entity that wants to store/process the data. \n\n\nFig: How Blockchain works\nIn the above image, as you can see, whenever a transaction is requested by the user using a blockchain-based application, a respective block is created in the blockchain network for storing the data of that transaction. Then that block is sent to every node in the distributed peer-to-peer network that further validates the transaction. After the validation, nodes of the network receive a reward for the proof of work (which is an agreement between the various nodes - also known as distributed consensus). Then, the block gets added into the existing Blockchain and the user gets a successful transaction.\n\nThe reason why the blockchain has acquired such a lot of adoration is that:\n\nIt\u2019s anything but claimed by a single entity, therefore it is decentralized\nBlockchain stores data cryptographically\nData tampering in Blockchain is nearly impossible\nThe blockchain is transparent which makes it untraceable\nWhat are the different types of Blockchain?\nThere are three types of blockchains that exclude traditional databases and DLT. As follows:\n\nType 1. Public Blockchains\nAll transactions that happen on public blockchains are completely transparent, implying that anybody can analyze the transaction subtleties. Ex: Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nType 2: Private Blockchains\nAll transactions that occur on private blockchains are private and are simply accessible to the members of the system that have been allowed to join the private blockchain network. Ex: Hyperledger and R3 Corda.\n\nType 3: Consortium Blockchains\nConsortium blockchains are quite similar to private blockchains. The main difference between them is that consortium blockchains are not governed by a single entity, it is governed by a group. Participants in consortium blockchains could incorporate anybody from national banks to governments, to supply chains.\n\nBest Practices for building secure Blockchain solutions?\nDefine and enforce endorsement agreements based on business contracts.\nEnable identity and access management (IAM) controls to handle data access in the blockchain.\nExecute suitable tokens like OAUTH, OIDC, and SAML2 to perform user authentication, verification, and authorization.\nSecurely store identity keys.\nUse privileged access management (PAM) solution to secure blockchain ledger entries after suitable business logic.\nSafeguard API-based transactions with API security best practices.\nUse a data classification approach to safeguard data or user information.\nUse privacy-preserving technologies for sensitive information.\nUse standard TLS for internal and external communications.\nImplement multi-factor authentication.\nKeep strong cryptographic key management.\nLeverage hardware security module (HSM) and security incident and event management (SIEM).\nDo regular vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT)\nPatch security loopholes to protect blockchain-based applications from vulnerabilities and data breaches.\nGet an industry-recognized security certification for your Blockchain solution.\nEnforce compliance and other security controls for the solution.\nWhat is Blockchain penetration testing?\nBlockchain penetration testing is a security assessment process done by ethical hackers or security professionals to test the security strength of the blockchain-based solution or application. \n\nThe main aim of blockchain penetration testing is to uncover vulnerabilities and security loopholes and identify misconfiguration errors in the solution. By performing Blockchain penetration testing, organizations get insights on the overall security posture of their blockchain security and also allow them to fix the potential weaknesses for their blockchain-based solutions or applications.\n\nHow to do Blockchain Penetration Testing?\nTo make it easy to understand, we\u2019ve divided the blockchain penetration testing into the following 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1: Information Gathering and Threat Modeling\nIn this phase, you can understand and analyze the business and functional requirements. \n\nThis phase includes:\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain architecture\nFinding threat entry points within the organization\nGathering of publicly available data on potential exploits\nEvaluate Smart Contract Business Logic\nSetting objectives for conducting security testing\nFull test strategy designing\nChecking Compliance readiness\nSetting up the testing environment\nCreation of test data\nPhase 2: Testing/Discovery\nIn this phase, you can use the data acquired in the first phase to play out the active testing of your blockchain to decide its development level estimated against best practices and industry guidelines.\n\nThis phase includes:\n\nAPI Security Testing\nFunctional Testing\nAutomatic and Manual Blockchain Security Analysis\nBlockchain Static and Dynamic Testing\nNetwork Vulnerability Assessment\nApplication Vulnerability Assessment\nBlockchain Integrity Assessment\nDocumenting Testing Discoveries\nPhase 3: Exploitation\nIn this phase, the objective is to use any weaknesses or security loopholes found in the Discovery stage. This is frequently done manually to get rid of false positives. The exploitation phase also involves the exfiltration of data from the target and looking after perseverance.\n\nThis phase includes:\n\nVerifying Security Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities\nExploiting Security Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities\nNetwork Penetration Testing\nWeb Application Penetration Testing\nTest against Social Engineering Attacks\nReview and Document Discoveries\nMake your API calls the safest interaction on the Internet\n\nwith our detailed and specially\ncurated API security checklist.\n\nDownload Checklist\ncharacter\nWhat are the Blockchain Security Testing tools?\nSWC-registry - Smart contract weakness classification and test cases.\nMythX- It is asmart contract securityanalysis API that supports Ethereum, Quorum, Vechain, Roostock, Tron, and other EVM-compatible blockchains.\nEchidna - It is a Haskell program designed for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smarts contracts.\nManticore - It is a symbolic execution tool for the analysis of smart contracts and binaries.\nOyente - A static analysis tool for smart contract security.\nSecurify 2.0 - Securify 2.0 is a security scanner for Ethereum smart contracts.\nSmartCheck - Static smart contract security analyzer.\nOctopus - It is a security analysis framework for the WebAssembly module and blockchain smart contract.\nSurya - Surya is a utility tool for smart contract systems.\nSolgraph- Generates aDOTgraph that visualizes the function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.\nSolidity security blog - Contains a comprehensive list of crypto-related hacks, bugs, vulnerabilities, and preventative measures.\nAwesome Buggy ERC20 Tokens - A collection of vulnerabilities in ERC20 smart contracts with tokens affected\nProfessional Blockchain Security Audit by AstraSecurity\nAstra Security offers a wide range of cybersecurity solutions including security audit and penetration testing for Blockchain-based solutions and applications.
