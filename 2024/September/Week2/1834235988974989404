I'm looking forward to finding some cool bugs and working with the\nbest people in the game ? I\nstarted my Web3 security career with contests at Code4rena, and I'm very\ngrateful to have been invited to join their Zenith program about a year later!\nIn this program, the top researchers on Code4rena can participate in private\naudits and join contests as ZR (Zenith Researchers). So you might find me\ncompeting in your next Rust contest\n?"
