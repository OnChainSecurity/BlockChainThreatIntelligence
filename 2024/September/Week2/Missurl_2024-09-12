Circle\u2019s USDC is no exception, stemming from the innovations of the ERC-20 standard and countless third-party frameworks to become the trusted dollar-backed stablecoin that it is today.\nAs of November 2023, USDC is issued and circulating natively on 15 blockchains - 7 more than last year - and yet it is also clear to Circle and the broader community that many more blockchains may emerge and rise to prominence over the next several years. These new blockchains could benefit significantly from having access to USDC.\n \nNative USDC vs. Bridged USDC\nAs we all know, native USDC provides unique advantages over bridged forms of USDC. Native issuance of USDC means that developers and users can trust that the asset they're using is fully reserved and always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. Native USDC can be supported in Circle products like Circle Mint and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), contributing to deeper ecosystem interactions and opportunities.\n Interestingly, bridged forms of USDC play a key role in solving the \"cold start\" problem for generating activity on new blockchain networks. Unlike native USDC, bridged forms of USDC can be spun up quickly by new L1 and L2 rollup teams, in addition to third-party bridge deployers. While bridged USDC is unofficial and not issued nor redeemable by Circle, it serves as a proxy to USDC that\u2019s extensible to any ecosystem where bridging is made possible. This helps developers bootstrap stablecoin liquidity for their applications and enables users to begin exploring new use cases early.\nIdeally, Circle could bring native USDC to every secure, safe and promising new blockchain network as soon as it launches. But with the meteoric rise of scaling solutions like L2s/L3s, modular blockchains, and new high performance L1s, Circle faces a significant challenge with ecosystem innovation outpacing the speed of new USDC deployments.\nAs a result, Circle has often been launching native USDC on new blockchains after a large amount of USDC liquidity had already been bridged by third parties. While it\u2019s true that developers and users can readily migrate from bridged USDC to native USDC, the ideal scenario would be to avoid a migration entirely.\nSo, how can Circle simultaneously enable an early path to native USDC for new blockchains, solve the cold start problem, and avoid the pitfalls of liquidity fragmentation and lengthy migrations?\nThis brings us back to permissionless composability and the power of community.\nIntroducing: Bridged USDC Standard\nBridged USDC Standard is a specification and process for deploying a bridged form of USDC on EVM blockchains with optionality for Circle to seamlessly upgrade to native issuance in the future.1 \n\nThe result is a secure and standardized way for any EVM blockchain and rollup team to transfer ownership of a bridged USDC token contract to Circle to facilitate an upgrade to native USDC, if and when both parties deem appropriate.2 \n \n\nPermissionless and equitable: Anyone can incorporate the standard to deploy a bridged USDC token contract, such as new L1 and L2 rollup teams, or chain-sponsored third-party bridge deployers\nStandardized and extensible: The process to securely transition ownership of a bridged USDC token contract to Circle follows a set procedure that's also extensible to bridged EURC\nSecure and audited: The standard consists of open-source ERC-20 contract code based on the same audited USDC smart contract that has secured billions of dollars in liquidity\nHere's how it works:\nThird-party team follows the standard to deploy their bridged USDC token contract.\nBridged USDC is used to bootstrap initial liquidity in the ecosystem and begins to proliferate.\nBridged USDC reaches a significant supply, amount of holders, and number of app integrations.\nCircle and third-party team jointly elect to securely transfer ownership of the bridged USDC token contract to Circle.2\nUpon obtaining ownership, Circle upgrades bridged USDC to native USDC and seamlessly retains existing supply, holders, and app integrations.3\nThe benefits obtained by upgrading in-place are numerous, as the contract address, user balances, and application integrations are all maintained, ensuring a seamless experience for developers and users. Liquidity fragmentation and migration learning curves are no longer obstacles to overcome.\n\nBenefits for all actors in the value chain\nBlockchains: Get bridged USDC into the hands of developers and users early with the potential for a seamless upgrade to native USDC in the future.\nDevelopers: Build on bridged USDC with a contract address that will persist after an upgrade to native USDC. No code change needed to support a new asset.\nUsers: Store, pay, trade, borrow, and lend with bridged USDC that automatically becomes native USDC upon an upgrade. No need to swap to a new asset.\nEveryone: Avoid the time-consuming liquidity migration process of educating and incentivizing users to move from bridged USDC to native USDC.\nImplementations are already live\nWe\u2019re proud to share that the teams at Linea and Scroll have already followed the standard for their bridged USDC token contracts on their respective testnet and mainnet networks. Recently on testnet, both Linea and Scroll were able to conduct a secure transition of their respective bridged USDC token contracts to Circle\u2019s ownership, which successfully simulates the equivalent procedure for mainnet.2 \n\n \nWhat this means for modular EVM architectures\nCircle expects to expand upon the available configurations for the standard to match the specifications of the most common modular EVM architectures, such as the OP Stack. The vision for Bridged USDC Standard is to be widely incorporated into Rollup as a Service (RaaS) offerings, such that it\u2019s easy to deploy a new blockchain with a templatized bridged USDC token contract that\u2019s compatible with the standard by default.\n\nThe standard can also be extended to Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin by incorporating the specification when deploying a bridged EURC token contract. We\u2019re also exploring how the standard can be re-factored for non-EVM blockchains and where commonalities exist to provide a scalable solution.\n\n \n\nHow to get started\nIf you\u2019re a new EVM blockchain team or you\u2019re a third-party bridge deployer working closely with one, dive into our implementation guide to learn how to deploy a bridged USDC token contract that follows the standard today.\n\nPlease reach out on Discord to help us assess further improvements and extensions. We welcome all feedback and innovative approaches from the community.\n\nFAQs\nIs Circle obligated to upgrade bridged USDC to native USDC?\n\nNo. Bridged USDC Standard grants Circle the option, but not the obligation, to obtain ownership of the token contract and upgrade to native USDC. In general, Circle\u2019s decision to upgrade a particular form of bridged USDC to native USDC may be subject to additional terms and conditions.\n\n \n\nCan an existing bridged USDC token contract be sufficiently upgraded to match the Bridged USDC Standard?\n\nUnfortunately, no. An existing bridged USDC token contract cannot be upgraded to match the Bridged USDC Standard if the original contract deployment did not follow the standard\u2019s technical requirements.\n\n \n\nIf I\u2019m a third-party bridge provider, can I partner with a blockchain team to deploy a bridged USDC that follows the standard for their canonical bridge?\n\nYes, absolutely. Blockchain teams may benefit from the technical expertise and resources that third-party bridge providers can provide for deploying a bridged USDC token contract that follows the Bridged USDC Standard.\n\n \n\nWhat\u2019s the threshold of supply or holders that Circle is looking to see before considering upgrading a bridged USDC contract to native USDC?\n\nThere is no exact threshold of supply or holders. Circle evaluates an assortment of factors prior to considering a native deployment of USDC, or in this case, an upgrade of bridged USDC to native USDC. In general, both the size and growth rate of bridged USDC supply, holders, and apps supported will contribute significantly to how Circle prioritizes native issuance for USDC.\n\n \n\nIs the Bridged USDC Standard appropriate for EVM appchains and parachains in the Cosmos and Polkadot ecosystems respectively?\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the standard can be followed to deploy bridged USDC on any EVM blockchain, USDC already exists natively in the Cosmos and Polkadot ecosystems:\n\nUSDC for the Cosmos ecosystem is natively issued on Noble and can be transferred to Cosmos appchains via Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).\nUSDC for the Polkadot ecosystem is natively issued on Asset Hub and can be transferred to Polkadot parachains via Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM).\nAs such, Circle intends for USDC to be accessed via the established protocols in each ecosystem. However, each sovereign appchain and parachain is free to choose if they prefer to deploy a bridged USDC token contract.\n\n \n\nYou mentioned Bridged USDC Standard can be extended to bridged EURC as well. What about other bridged ERC-20 token contracts?\n\nIn time, we intend to explore up-leveling the standard to provide a generalized framework for any bridged ERC-20 token contract - ideally helping to address liquidity fragmentation for the broader industry of asset issuers.\n\nWe\u2019re also open to collaborating with the community on other approaches to help solve this shared problem, such as xERC-20 (aka ERC-7281).\n\n \n\nI have ideas for how you could extend the Bridged USDC Standard to additional architectures. How can I contribute?\n\nPlease reach out on Discord to help us assess further improvements and extensions. We welcome all feedback and innovative approaches from the community."
