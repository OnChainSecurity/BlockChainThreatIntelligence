It is anticipated that deposits and withdrawals will resume in\napproximately 2-3 weeks, pending the successful completion of these audits. In\ncollaboration with\n\n[@hexagate_](/hexagate_)\n\n, we are integrating real-time monitoring to establish a highly efficient and\nproactive response system. We continue to work closely with law enforcement,\nsecurity firms, partners, and key members of the crypto community, including\nmajor exchanges, to trace, track, and freeze funds linked to the hacker. Also,\nsteps are being taken to prepare a post on the Penpie governance forum to open\ndiscussions on a potential compensation plan. To our users and partners, thank\nyou for your ongoing support and patience as we navigate through this process."
