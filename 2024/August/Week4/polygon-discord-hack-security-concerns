One Polygon user, shadabk2005, took to the X platform to warn others of the ongoing situation. \n\n\nSource: Mudit Gupta\n\nAccording to the user, the support channel on Polygon\u2019s Discord was flooded with people seeking help, only to be misled by scammers posing as legitimate support agents. \"There are scam links being posted in the announcements channel,\" the user noted, adding that he was given a timeout for trying to highlight the issue.\n\nThe severity of the attack became even more apparent when another user, ValidatorK, reported a loss of $150,000 worth of Ether \nETH\n\ntickers down\n$2,530\n\n from his pool. The funds were lost in one fell swoop following an interaction with what appeared to be an official announcement on Polygon\u2019s Discord channel. \n\nDiscord hacks\nThe attack on Polygon\u2019s Discord is the latest in a series of high-profile breaches that have plagued the crypto community.\n\nRelated: Polygon launches upgraded ZK proving system Plonky3\n\nOn March 25, 2023, blockchain security firm CertiK highlighted a phishing scam circulating on the Arbitrum Discord server. The scam - believed to have been orchestrated through a hacked developer account - involved a fake announcement containing a malicious link. \n\nSimilarly, on May 5, the Gnus.AI artificial intelligence network fell victim to a Discord-related exploit resulting in a loss of approximately $1.27 million.\n\nThe timing of this breach is particularly concerning for Polygon, which is currently undergoing a significant network upgrade. \n\nThe platform plans to replace its native Polygon \nMATIC\n\ntickers down\n$0.4081\n\n token with POL tokens as part of an upgrade scheduled for Sept. 4. The POL upgrade is designed to expand the utility of Polygon\u2019s native token and power its growing network of aggregated blockchains, known as AggLayer."
