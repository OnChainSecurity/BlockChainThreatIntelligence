This way, the teams can pass through protocol and make sure that it functions under high-intensity situations. But also, researchers can test their skills in being a black hat or a white hat.\"\nThe initiative\u2019s first event, Battle.net, will be hosted at the DeFi Security Summit at Devcon between Nov. 7 and 9.\n\nThe white hat initiative comes nearly a month after a hacker stole over $230 million from WazirX, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, in the second-largest cryptocurrency hack of 2024 so far.\n\n\nsamczsun keynote speech.

The SDF is another nonprofit whose mission is to provide grants to security researchers interfacing with legal issues.\"\n\nSEAL Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement.

If this trend continues, the total could reach about 24 attacks by year-end, slightly surpassing the total for 2023.\"\nNearly 80% of cryptocurrencies never recover in pricing after a hack or exploit, according to a report by onchain security firm Immunefi. This devaluation often causes more damage to projects than the exploit itself."
