His answer : \"castToUint128(bytes32 input) first casts the input to an\nuint256 integer, then truncates the higher128 bits and only keeps the lower\n128 bits. When converting from a larger integer type to a smaller one, the\nbehavior is truncation: 1\\. The higher-order bits are simply cut off. 2\\. Only\nthe least significant bits that fit into the smaller type are kept. 3\\. This\ncan lead to loss of information if the original value is larger than what can\nbe represented in the smaller type. 4\\. There's no automatic check for\noverflow, which can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.\ncastToBytes16(bytes32 input) takes the first 16 bytes from the input and\nreturns a bytes16 type value. When converting from a larger bytes type to a\nsmaller one, the behavior is different: 1\\. It takes the leftmost (most\nsignificant) bytes of the larger type. 2\\. The rightmost bytes are discarded.\n3\\. This is essentially taking a \"prefix\" of the original bytes.\""
