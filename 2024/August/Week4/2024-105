        "original_content": "SEC Charges Abra with Unregistered Offers and Sales of Crypto Asset Securities\nAbra also allegedly operated as an unregistered investment company\nFor Immediate Release\n\n2024-105\nWashington D.C., Aug. 26, 2024 -\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Plutus Lending LLC, which does business as Abra, for failing to register the offers and sales of its retail crypto asset lending product, Abra Earn. The SEC also charged Abra with operating as an unregistered investment company.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, in or around July 2020, Abra began to offer and sell Abra Earn in the United States. Abra Earn allowed U.S. investors to tender their crypto assets to Abra in exchange for Abra\u2019s promise to pay a variable interest rate. At its height, the Abra Earn program had approximately $600 million in assets, with nearly $500 million from U.S. investors. The complaint alleges that Abra marketed Abra Earn as a means for investors to earn interest on their crypto assets \"auto-magically,\" and that Abra exercised its discretion to use investors\u2019 crypto assets in various ways to generate income for itself and to fund interest payments. The complaint further alleges that Abra Earn was offered and sold as a security and that the offers and sales did not qualify for an exemption from SEC registration.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that Abra operated for at least two years as an unregistered investment company because it issued securities and held more than 40 percent of its total assets, excluding cash, in investment securities, including its loans of crypto assets to institutional borrowers. According to the complaint, in June 2023, Abra began winding down the Abra Earn program and told its U.S.-based Abra Earn customers to withdraw their crypto assets.\n\n\"As alleged, Abra sold nearly half a billion dollars of securities to U.S. investors, without complying with registration laws designed to ensure that investors have sufficient, accurate information to make informed decisions before they invest,\" said Stacy Bogert, Associate Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \"To compound the potential harm to investors, Abra allegedly sold its own securities while skirting applicable Investment Company Act provisions that provide a number of important protections to investors, including minimizing conflicts of interest. This matter reflects yet again that, in conducting enforcement investigations, we are governed by economic realities, not cosmetic labels.\"\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Abra with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 7(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. To settle the Commission\u2019s charges, Abra, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, has consented to an injunction prohibiting it from violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act and requiring it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Brittany Frassetto and Kevin Hayne under the supervision of Pei Y. Chung and Ms. Bogert. The litigation will be led by Zachary Avallone and supervised by Christopher Bruckmann.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and Enforcement\u2019s Retail Strategy Task Force has previously issued an Investor Bulletin on Crypto Asset Interest-bearing Accounts.
