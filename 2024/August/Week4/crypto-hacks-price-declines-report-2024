He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\"The millions lost to the hack immediately anticipate even larger losses, caused by market impact and dependency impact, alongside many months of lost time spent rebuilding your emotionally shattered team and operations.\"\n\nMedia token price declines after hack.

For example, a leaked private key will lead to the theft of all funds controlled by it.\"\nFrom the $1.19 billion worth of digital assets stolen to date in 2024, $636 million is attributed to CeFi vulnerabilities.\n\n\nMedian token price declines six months after hack. Source: Immunefi\n\nHackers are increasingly targeting CeFi infrastructure like crypto exchanges due to the large amount of funds that could potentially result in hundreds of millions in stolen bounty, explained Amador.\n\nImmunefi is a prominent onchain crowdsourced cybersecurity platform, safeguarding over $190 billion in user funds.\n\nRelated: Polychain leads $6.7M investment in new Bitcoin-centric yield network Corn\n\nEstablished crypto projects suffer less damage post-hack\nSome cryptocurrencies fare better after an exploit.\n\n\nToken price declines, major exploits. Source: Immunefi\n\nTokens with a more established team that belong to larger projects historically are more resilient to exploits, according to Amador:\n\n\"Recovered tokens include projects like BNB Chain, SushiSwap, THORChain, Olympus, and Optimism. All of these projects are either huge ecosystems themselves, such as BNB Chain or Optimism, or are longstanding protocols like SushiSwap, which have a dedicated community.\"\nThis is mainly due to larger ecosystems behind these tokens that exert more buying power after a black swan event, explained Amador. \n\nCrypto hacks remain among the biggest hurdles of mass cryptocurrency adoption since the amount of stolen funds in 2024 could surpass the previous year.\n\nBy Feb. 29, over $200 million had been lost to hacks year-to-date, reflecting a more than 15% increase compared to the same period in 2023, when $173 million worth of digital assets were stolen."
