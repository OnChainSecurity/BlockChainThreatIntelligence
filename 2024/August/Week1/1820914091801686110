        "original_content": "Breakdown Part 2: Another bug in the following snippet that most people were\nnot able to guess is that Lido has a minimum and maximum withdrawal limit.\nIssues are: 1\\. The code snippet doesn't let the user break down the\nwithdrawal into multiple chunks, hence causing a DOS in case the deposit is\ngreater than the maximum withdrawal limit. 2\\. The deposit function has no\nminimum deposit check, hence a user can deposit a small amount that will be\npermanently stuck."
