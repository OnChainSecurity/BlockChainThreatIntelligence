The newly discovered malware can steal a vast array of material, including cryptocurrency, through a mechanism known as clipping. It is freely available on a rental basis on the developer\u2019s website.\n\nWindows users with an up-to-date operating system are safe from the malware, since Styx Stealer depends on a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Defender that was patched last year.\n\nMalware upgraded to steal crypto\nStyx Stealer was discovered because the developer experienced a data leak during debugging. It is derived from an older malware called Phemedrone Stealer. It maintains the functions of Phemedrone Stealer, such as stealing saved passwords, cookies, auto-fill data, cryptocurrency wallet data and instant messenger sessions, while incorporating new detection evasion techniques and adding a crypto clipper function.\n\nCryptocurrency clipping occurs when malware substitutes a crypto recipient\u2019s wallet address with the bad actor\u2019s wallet during a transaction.\n\n\nStyx Stealer crypto clipper user interface.

The pricing and features were displayed on the website styxcrypter.com until midday on Aug. 16, when they were replaced with information about another product.

Source: Check Point Research\nHacking is paying well in 2024\nPoint Research identified eight wallets presumably belonging to the Turkey-based Styx Stealer developer that had received around $9,500 in crypto as payment for the malware in the first two months of its operation.\n\n\nSource: Check Point Research\nCheck Point Research also obtained the developer\u2019s Telegram accounts, email addresses, phone numbers and contacts.\n\nAccording to a report released by Chainalysis on Aug. 15, legitimate cryptocurrency activity is growing faster than illicit activity, although the value of the crypto hacked has increased. That is at least in part due to the price recovery of Bitcoin. The number of hacking incidents in 2024 has increased only marginally year-on-year."
