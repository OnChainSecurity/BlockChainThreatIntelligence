For this reason we are only able to attempt to recover funds over the value of $300 in the case of a simple recovery. Or over $3,000 for complicated recoveries. Our team will tell you how complicated we expect the recovery to be so if in doubt please reach out. \nUpon successful completion of this work Blockchain.com will keep 10% of the recovered funds and return the remaining 90% to the original deposit address or to your Blockchain.com Account where security permits. \nIn certain cases, the recovered funds will be returned to the original sender's address. If the deposit originated from another platform, you will need to contact that platform for further assistance accessing the funds once our work has been completed.\nFor cases in which the unique deposit memo or tag is incorrect or missing, we might ask you to make another minimum deposit of 1 XLM/XRP from the same address that the missing deposit originated from but with your correct memo/tag included. This is so we can verify that you are the owner of the depositing account before we return any lost funds to that address. \nRecovering assets in this way can take time as our engineers may need to make changes to our infrastructure in order to recover your funds. This may take 3+ months for our teams to complete depending on complexity. We appreciate your patience during this time. \n\n\nFunds sent to your Blockchain.com Wallet Account or Blockchain.com Exchange Account\nScenario 1:\nIf you\u2019ve sent:\n\na token without the required unique memo or tag (for example XLM or XRP) \na supported token to the wrong Blockchain.com Account address (over Ethereum, Tron, Celo or Theta networks only)\nIn cases like these, we can only attempt to recover funds which are equal to or greater than $300 at the time that the recovery request is made.\n\nUpon successful completion of this work Blockchain.com will keep 10% of the recovered funds and return the remaining 90% to the original deposit address or to your Blockchain.com Account where security permits. \n\nFor cases like this where a unique deposit memo or tag is required but was submitted incorrectly or was missing, we might ask you to make another minimum deposit of 1 XLM/XRP from the same address as the initial unidentified deposit with your correct memo/tag included so that we can verify you are the owner of the depositing account. \n\nPlease fill out this form with all the required details so that we can review your request and proceed with the recovery process. \n\n \n\nScenario 2:\nIf you\u2019ve sent: \n\nan unsupported token to your Blockchain.com Account address (over Ethereum, Tron, Celo or Theta networks only)\nIn cases like these, we can only attempt to recover funds which are equal to or greater than $3,000 at the time that the recovery request is made due to the complexity of the engineering work involved.\n\nUpon successful completion of this work Blockchain.com will keep 10% of the recovered funds and return the remaining 90% to the original deposit address.\n\nIf the deposit originated from another platform, you will need to contact that platform for further assistance accessing the funds once our work has been completed.\n\nRecovering assets in this way can take time and may take 3+ months for our teams to complete.\n\nPlease fill out this form with all the required details so that we can review your request and proceed with the recovery process. \n\n \n\nScenario 3:\nIf you\u2019ve sent: \n\nBitcoin (BTC) to your Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Blockchain.com Account or vice versa\nany token to your Blockchain.com Account over the unsupported network (including BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Cronos, Optimism, KuCoin Chain etc.)\nUnfortunately, due to the complex technical aspects and incompatibility of these blockchains, we will not be able to assist you in recovering these funds. To avoid future loss of funds, please only send crypto to its respective receiving address over the supported network.\n\n \n\nFunds sent to your Blockchain.com DeFi Wallet\nAssets held in your DeFi wallet are non-custodial and unrecoverable by Blockchain.com but we may still be able to help in some cases. \n\nIf you\u2019ve sent:\n\nan unsupported ERC-20 token to your ETH DeFi Wallet address\nany other token to your ETH DeFi Wallet address over the unsupported network (such as Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Optimism, KuCoin Chain etc.)  \nYou will need to export the ETH private key of your Blockchain.com DeFi Wallet and import it into a third-party wallet that supports the particular token or network in question. This export functionality is only available in the web wallet. Once you are logged in, please follow these steps:\n\n \n\n1. Select Wallets & Addresses from the settings menu in the top-right corner\n\n2. Click on the Ethereum tab near the top of the page\n\n3. Read the warning message, then click Show to view your private key\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have obtained your private key, you will be able to import it into a third-party wallet or platform which supports the particular token or network in question. \n\nFor help with importing your private key into a third-party wallet, please contact the third-party wallet's support team directly. Unfortunately, Blockchain.com is unable to provide support for third-party wallets and we cannot be responsible for their safety, security, or functionality.\n\n \n\nIf you have lost your DeFi wallet password or recovery seed, we are unable to restore this for you. We may be able to refer you to our partners at https://cryptoassetrecovery.com/for further assistance. So please contact us if you would like to discuss this further. \n\n \n\nImportant note:\n\nYou should never share your private key with any other parties as this will compromise your funds. Blockchain.com will never ask for your Recovery Phrase or private keys."
