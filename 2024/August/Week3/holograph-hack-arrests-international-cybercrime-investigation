As a result, significant assets and electronics have been frozen and seized. The suspects, whose names have not been disclosed due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, are expected to be extradited to France to face charges soon.\n\nThe hack involved a sophisticated attack on the Holograph protocol, a blockchain tokenization platform operating within the Omnichain ecosystem. \n\nOn June 13, a malicious actor exploited the protocol\u2019s operator contract to mint 1 billion native Holograph (HLG) tokens valued at $14.4 million using a proxy wallet. The incident caused a dramatic plunge in the value of HLG tokens, which dropped nearly 80% within nine hours of the exploit, from $0.014 to a low of $0.0029.\n\nFollowing the breach, Holograph initiated an internal investigation with the help of Halborn, a blockchain investigation firm. The company released a detailed post-mortem report on July 2, which identified the involvement of a \"disgruntled former contractor.\" \n\nHolograph\u2019s platform is designed to enable tokens to move seamlessly between blockchains while maintaining the same contract address. This functionality allows asset issuers to index cross-chain data efficiently. \n\nHack aftermath\nDespite the hack, Holograph has continued to strengthen its security measures and maintain its commitment to providing a robust and secure tokenization platform within the Omnichain ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Top 100 DeFi Hacks: Offchain attack vectors account for 57% of losses\n\nAs the investigation progresses, more details are expected to emerge, shedding light on the full extent of the hack and the measures being taken to prevent similar incidents. \n\nOn Aug. 8, the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX restored the balances of all platform accounts following the halt of withdrawals caused by a $235 million hack in July. \n\nThe exchange attributed the breach to discrepancies between the data displayed on Liminal\u2019s digital custody platform and the valid transaction details on WazirX.\n\nAs a result of the breach, the anonymous attacker reportedly stole at least $100 million in Shiba Inu \nSHIB\n\ntickers down\n$0.000014\n\n and $52 million in Ether \nETH\n\ntickers down\n$2,533\n\n. The loss accounted for 45% of WazirX\u2019s reserves."
