An exploiter transferred a substantial 14,500 ETH, worth about $35.2 million, to Tornado Cash. These transactions highlight the prevalent use of mixing services to obscure the origins of large sums of crypto assets, complicating efforts to track and recover stolen funds.\n\nThe use of services like Tornado Cash, which makes it difficult to trace the source of funds, has alarmed the crypto community and global regulators. This increased scrutiny has led to more legal action, as exemplified by the arrest and denial of bail for Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in the Netherlands. Pertsev has been imprisoned for over five years, underscoring the intense regulatory challenges faced by operators of crypto mixing services.\n\nIn response to these security concerns, OKX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has taken decisive action against the use of mixers. OKX\u2019s CEO, Star, announced on his X account a ban on accounts utilizing Tornado Cash. This move aims to align with global regulatory standards and enhance the platform\u2019s security against money laundering activities.\n\n\u88ab\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728okx\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u6237\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u6237\u6210\u529f\u7528\u6237\uff1a\n1. \u4ece\u88ab\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u6bd4\u5982 Garantex\u548c Tornado cash\u5145\u503c\u5230okx\n2. \u4eceokx\u63d0\u5e01\u53bb\u88ab\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\n\n\u90fd\u4f1a\u89e6\u53d1\u5408\u89c4\u98ce\u63a7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u88ab\u6e05\u9000\u8d26\u6237\u3002\n\n\u5236\u88c1\u548c\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u5f88\u9065\u8fdc\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u62c5\u5fc3\u3002 https://t.co/MTJ7OtQRny\n\n- Star (@star_okx) August 9, 2024\nDespite security and regulatory challenges, Ethereum\u2019s market value remains strong.
