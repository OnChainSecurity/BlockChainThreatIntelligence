Anyways here's our\nincident report for last week. Key Incidents:\n? Contract Vulnerability:\n-iVest DAO: A smart contract vulnerability led to a loss of ~$172K. -Ronin:\nThe Ronin Bridge was hit by an attack exploiting a contract vulnerability,\nresulting in the extraction of 4,000 ETH and 2 million USDC, worth around\n$12M. Fortunately, white hats returned the funds, earning a $500K bounty.\n? Account Compromise: -RARI\nFoundation: The official Discord server was hacked. Users are advised to stay\naway until the situation is resolved.\n? Unknown Attack Method:\n-Nexera: A suspicious transaction led to the takeover and upgrade of Nexera\u2019s\nproxy contract, resulting in a loss of ~$1.5M as the attacker sold NXRA tokens\nfor ETH, bridging some funds to the BNB chain.\n? Takeaways: \\- Smart\nContracts: Just because it\u2019s smart doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe. Audits. Audits.\nAudits. \\- Discord Servers: Hackers love using them. Be wary of those \u201curgent\u201d\nmessages. ? Here's some\nfood for thought: What\u2019s more terrifying\u2014losing millions in a split second or\nhaving to trust that someone will return it?\n? For the full breakdown at\n[http://hacked.slowmist.io](https://t.co/MoD7CYA9Gt) And as always, stay\nvigilant!"
