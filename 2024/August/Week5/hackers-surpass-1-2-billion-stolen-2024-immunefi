He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\"It\u2019s difficult to make predictions, but the ecosystem is always at risk of one severe and successful exploit that could significantly increase these numbers. We must remain vigilant at all times to mitigate such risks.\"\nThe report comes over a month after a hacker stole over $230 million from WazirX, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, in the second-largest cryptocurrency hack of 2024 so far.\n\n\nCrypto hacks in August.

Source: Immunefi\n\nMost of this sum was lost in two major incidents, including the $9.8 million Ronin Network hack and the $1.5 million Nexera exploit.\n\nBoth exploits stem from a vulnerability during code upgrade, noted Immunefi\u2019s Amador:\n\n\"Both the Ronin and Convergence incidents this month were due to vulnerabilities introduced during code upgrades. Convergence clarified in their post-mortem that they had \"modified [that] part of the code post-audit,\" which highlights the critical importance of maintaining a security-first approach at every step.\"\n\nLargest hacks in August.

Source: Immunefi\n\nWhile we generally see a higher number of DeFi exploits, CeFi incidents can be more catastrophic and lead to hundreds of millions in stolen value, explained Amador:\n\n\"Most of the losses in 2024 have been attributed to attacks on CeFi infrastructure. Although there were no reported or successful CeFi attacks this month, it doesn't necessarily mean these threats aren't occurring or won't lead to future losses.\"\nImmunefi is a prominent onchain crowdsourced cybersecurity platform, safeguarding over $190 billion in user funds."
