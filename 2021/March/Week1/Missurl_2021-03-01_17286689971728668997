(Stablecoins are pegged against a fiat currency and are not subject to the price volatilities of mainstream cryptocurrencies.)\nEthereum Foundation researchers are not eligible to participate in the bug bounty, but developers of the Eth2 client can participate under higher scrutiny conditions.\nOne thing to note is that the testing is being done against the \nEth2 specifications\n, as opposed to evaluating the actual implementation of the code.\nBlockchain audit\nThe Ethereum Foundation has already doled out $13,000 in rewards to three vulnerability disclosures, including a\u00a0\ncritical overflow bug\n.\nAfter the Phase 0 mainnet launches, the Ethereum 2.0 bounty program will be transferred to the standard \nEthereum Bounty Program\n.\n\u201cWe have a solid and well-tested spec, and we have a number of incredible teams building it out,\u201d Ethereum 2.0 project lead Danny Ryan told \nThe Daily Swig\n.\n\u201cAs with any new production system, we prepare for unknowns, but at the same time we do expect things to go well with the launch of eth2.\u201d\nRead more of the latest cryptocurrency security news\nThe \nbug bounty\n program comes on the heels of a thorough audit of the Phase 0 specification by Least Authority.\n\u201cWhen reviewing a specification as opposed to code that has already been implemented, certain assumptions are made about the kinds of vulnerabilities that might be present in an implementation,\u201d Hind Kurhan, senior program manager at Least Authority, told \nThe Daily Swig\n.\n\u201cHowever, our threat models and possible scenarios are not exhaustive, and we always recommend to our clients that coded implementations, in addition to specification review, be audited as a security best practice.\u201d\nOverall, the Least Authority team found the Eth2 specifications to be well thought out and comprehensive. \u201cIt is clear that security was strongly considered by the Ethereum 2.0 team during the design phase,\u201d they \nwrote in March\n.\nEthereum security: DoS and information leakage issues resolved\nIn their review, the Least Authority team found two main issues: a denial-of-service (DoS) vector in the P2P networking system, and a potential information leak in the block proposer system.\n\u201cDuring our engagement, the Ethereum 2.0 team implemented changes to the specification and responded to our issues following the delivery of our initial audit report,\u201d Kurhan said, adding that is not uncommon for projects to re-engage during later phases of design and development and do a follow-up review.\n\u201cWe would welcome the opportunity to engage with the Ethereum 2.0 team to review further progress for security issues.\u201d\nMajor upgrade\nThe biggest change in Ethereum will be a transition from the \u2018proof of work\u2019 consensus model to \u2018proof of stake\u2019.\nPoW, used in Ethereum 1.0 and Bitcoin, consists of a network of \u2018miners\u2019 competing to solve mathematical equations and validating new transaction blocks.\nThe computational resources required to solve the mining problems raise the costs of staging DoS attacks against the network. PoS, on the other hand, gives nodes voting rights on new blocks based on the number of coins they have.\nThe general assumption is that parties who have more of the cryptocurrency have a higher stake in maintaining the network online and keeping it free of fraudulent activity.\nProof-of-stake has been widely discussed in the blockchain community and there are already several cryptocurrencies that use PoS.\nBut Ethereum 2.0 will be the first large-scale implementation of PoS, which itself might portend unpredictable challenges for the long-term stability and security of the network.\nREAD MORE\n \nCryptojacking campaign infects up to 3,000 Windows machines a day\n\n\n\n"
