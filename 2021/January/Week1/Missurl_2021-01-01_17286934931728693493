        "original_content": "\n\nBalancer is one of the most popular automated market makers (AMMs) and decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum network. It allows users to instantly swap tokens and earn fees when they provide liquidity to different pools.\n\n\nBalancer competes with other platforms, such as ERC20-based \nUniswap\n and SushiSwap. It has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\nThe following aims to answer questions regarding Balancer, examine core features, customer support, security guarantees, and so forth.\n\n\nThe Balancer Protocol\n\n\nWith the use of liquidity pools, this AMM platform allows users to swap their ERC-20 assets without the need for a centralized entity or authority. Balancer users can also earn a share of trading fees as they provide liquidity.\n\n\nTo increase the liquidity on the Balancer Protocol, the platform offers several incentives to users. What sets it apart from some of the big guns in the AMM protocol space is that it goes as far as offering users enough flexibility to create their private liquidity pools.\n\n\nUsers can ultimately create pools using two or more crypto assets of their choice. Much like other notable automated market makers, Balancer routes its trades through any liquidity pools needed to secure the best rates for users.\n\n\nThe three main user demographics on Balancer include traders, investors, smart contracts, liquidity providers, and arbitrageurs (they capitalize on different price spreads across platforms.)\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nFully decentralized and permissionless\n\n\nLiquidity pools are open to anyone\n\n\nCustomizable AMMs\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n\nLimited only to ERC-20 Tokens\n\n\nNo mobile application is available\n\n\nHigh gas fees\n\n\nNot beginner-friendly\n\n\nUnregulated DEX\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Balancer?\n\n\nBalancer is a decentralized Ethereum-based exchange and one of the leading automated market makers (AMMs) in the cryptocurrency world. It runs on the Ethereum mainnet and allows users to benefit from several features to create DeFi products.\n\n\nIt was launched back in 2019 by the founders of Balancer Labs \u2013 Mike McDonald and Fernando Martinelli. Both co-founders are veteran contributors to the crypto industry and have collaborated to work on other blockchains and DeFi projects.\n\n\nThe development of Balancer began in 2018 with its bronze release. The rest of the three phases went live in 2020. The bronze release followed a round of funding in March 2020, with Balancer raising $3 million.\n\n\nIn the earlier years of Balancer\u2019s launch, about 100 million BAL tokens (Balancer\u2019s utility token) were minted. The protocol released 75% of them to miners and distributed 25% among its developers and shareholders. In the process, it sold out 5 million tokens to the public.\n\n\nBalancer Products and Features\n\n\nThe Balancer Exchange\n\n\n\n\nBalancer allows users to trade at optimal prices. The protocol encourages efficient trading via pooling crowdsourced liquidity from investor portfolios while using its Smart Order Routing feature to find the best prices for traders.\n\n\nUsers can exchange any combination of ERC-20 tokens on Balancer and get access to intelligent pricing, MEV protection, and gas subsidies/optimizations.\n\n\nSource: Official Website\n\n\nThe Trade App\n\n\nTo start using the protocol\u2019s Trade App, buy and sell or store cryptocurrencies, users only need to create a \nself-custody wallet\n.\n\n\nSource: Official Website\n\n\nThe BAL Token\n\n\nProviding liquidity or trading on the Balancer Protocol earns users BAL tokens.\n\n\nBAL tokens are claimable and \nused to participate\n in the Balancer governance protocols. In that case, liquidity providers are assigned voting rights depending on the percentage of tokens they hold or stake in the pool.\n\n\nThe Balancer Pools\n\n\nBalancer Pools run smart contracts and maintain value by having two or more ERC-20 tokens. Every token has its weight, and users can trade them with other tokens within that pool. The smart contracts readjust the pool to maintain a proportional and equal value of liquidity.\n\n\nDoing so keeps the value of each token proportional to the value of liquidity in the entire pool. Pool owners receive fees from the trades that happen within the pool. The protocol offers two major types of pools:\n\n\n\n\nPublic Pools\n: These pools allow anyone to provide liquidity to Balancer by adding digital assets. Creators can set the parameters of public pools before launching, and these parameters can\u2019t be changed even by them. Public Pools are vital for small-scale investors who prefer to earn fees from their holdings.\n\n\nPrivate Pools\n: Here, only the creator can add an asset or withdraw it. The creator can also adjust the parameters of the pool, including weightings, acceptable assets, and fees. Private pools are great for asset managers who own large portfolios and prefer to earn fees on specific digital assets.\n\n\n\n\nBalancer\u2019s open design allows anybody to create their pool type while choosing between different functions and flexible pricing options.\n\n\nBelow are some examples of the many pool choices available for different token combinations.\n\n\n\n\nStable Pools\n: Stable Pools are suitable for soft-pegged tokens with a high correlation coefficient like DAI/USDC/USDT.\n\n\nWeighted Pools\n: Weighted pools are designed for wide use, including some tokens that don\u2019t have a price connection like DAI/WETH.\n\n\nMetaStable Pools\n: These are designed to support non-pegged tokens that preserve correlation. Such tokens, however, may diverge over time, and a derivative is a good example.\n\n\nManaged Pools\n: These are built to provide maximum and solid flexibility needed to manage dynamic funds.\n\n\nLiquidity Bootstrapping Pools\n: These pools are useful for modifying the liquidity of one token into another one.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vault\n\n\nThe vault is Balancer\u2019s central component. It is a smart contract that controls and stores all tokens in each Balancer pool. In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, the vault serves as a gateway through which users carry out most operations like joins, swaps, and exits.\n\n\nToken management and accounting are separated from the pool logic in the Vault. Balancer claims Pool contracts become easier since they don\u2019t need to manage assets actively and only compute exits, swaps and joins.\n\n\nBalancer Protocol. Source: The official website\n\n\nSmart Order Router (SOR)\n\n\nBalancer\u2019s Smart Order Router helps its traders find the best pricing possible. It identifies the best trades for a specific set of output and input tokens if they are a straight swap in one pool or a mix of transactions across several pools.\n\n\nThe Smart Order Router increases with the expansion of the diversity of Balancer Pools, and it keeps growing as extra pool types with different math are introduced. This means that the Balancer ecosystem\u2019s pools can all execute trades.\n\n\nAlso, by integrating and connecting with the Smart Order Router, any custom pool on Balancer can use Balancer\u2019s liquidity features.\n\n\nBalancer Gnosis Partnership (BGP)\n\n\nOn app.balancer.fi, the Balancer Gnosis Partnership is the default trading interface. It employs Gnosis Solvers and the Balancer Vault to carry out trades in batches. Traders can submit swaps using Gnosis Solvers by signing a message that initiates a gasless transaction.\n\n\nTo keep traders safe for Miner Extractable Value or MEV, the Solvers match transactions using on-chain liquidity, facilitating taking advantage of Coincidence of Wants. BGP uses several Dexes to guarantee traders always receive the best prices.\n\n\nBGP\u2019s solid integration with Balancer\u2019s Vault allows it to carry out sophisticated multi-hop deals with minimum token transfers while lowering transaction costs. It groups gasless transactions, ensuring that unsuccessful traders don\u2019t lead to a fee loss.\n\n\nHow to Open a Balancer Account\n\n\nGetting started on Balancer is straightforward. The platform\u2019s UX makes access and navigation seamless, providing useful and well-placed tools to trade, invest, and withdraw tokens.\n\n\nTraders and portfolio managers can leverage Balancer\u2019s unique products and features to invest or build on the platform to create new innovative types of decentralized financial applications (dApps).\n\n\nOn the top left corner of \nBalancer\u2019s homepage\n, users will find options to use Balancer\u2019s Invest App, Trade App, or the Build option.\n\n\nFees and Commissions on Balancer\n\n\nOn Balancer, every pool charges a different fee. Besides, the number of fees charged may depend on the choice of a pool\u2019s developer, and some fees can range from 0.0001% to 10%. Let\u2019s find out some fees applicable to the Balancer protocol.\n\n\nBalancer Exchange Trading Fees\n\n\nTrading fees are a proportion of every transaction crypto traders pay to pool LPs and are established by pool developers. With centralized exchanges, users get charged a takers fee from takers and a makers fee from makers.\n\n\nTakers are users who remove liquidity from the order book when they accept previously placed orders. Makers are users who place these orders.\n\n\nAn alternative to charging separate takers and makers\u2019 fees is charging the same flat fees to the maker and the taker. With decentralized exchanges like Balancer, there are no available trading fees. So, in terms of trading fees, Balancer doesn\u2019t charge users.\n\n\nNetwork Fees\n\n\nNetwork fees are paid to particular blockchain or crypto miners and aren\u2019t fees paid to the Balancer exchange. Network fees are not fixed; they vary occasionally. Their figures depend on the pressure on the network at any given time.\n\n\nSupported Devices\n\n\nBalancer doesn\u2019t have a mobile app available on Android or iOS. However, users can run the exchange on its web app using a mobile phone or desktop.\n\n\nCustomer Support\n\n\nUsers can chat with Balancer\u2019s customer support, and this is a feature that sets it apart from many \u2018decentralized\u2019 competitors.\n\n\nBesides the live chat functionality on the website, users are also free to send an email to contact@balancer.finance , or reach out through LinkedIn or Twitter.\n\n\nSupported Cryptocurrencies\n\n\nBalancer does not support tokens that don\u2019t match the ERC-20 standard, even if they are used on certain pools.\n\n\nThe platform also doesn\u2019t control the tokens held in the Balancer pools; they are smart contracts. To prevent tokens with known flaws from being used in pools, the configurable rights pools, or CPRs, are set in place.\n\n\nBalancer\u2019s native token is also listed on some established crypto exchanges and trading platforms for secure transactions. These platforms include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Crypto.com, and Bithumb.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nThe Balancer protocol has no admin keys or backdoors, making it a fully trustless one where users can\u2019t upgrade Balancer pools. Below are some of Balancer\u2019s security mechanisms:\n\n\n\n\nBalancer Is Fully Audited\n: Balancer audits with Trail of Bits, Certora, and OpenZeppelin. It regularly undergoes more audits to ensure it meets security and dex standards.\n\n\nBug Bounty Program\n: Balancer is running an ongoing bug bounty program within the V2 release of its core contracts. The reward paid will depend on the severity of the bug. Bug bounties will apply to the Balancer smart contracts responsible for securing protocol funds on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\n\n\n\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, Balancer is permissionless, so there\u2019s always the chance of faulty or malicious tokens being introduced at the contract level. Here\u2019s what Balancer\u2019s response to all of this is:\n\n\n\n\nBalancer continues to evaluate and audit the protocol on an ongoing basis.\n\n\nIt has added transfer fee tokens to the UI blacklist.\n\n\nBalancer also added additional documentation about the dangers linked with how pools operate and how tokens that people maliciously construct might drain funds from a pool.\n\n\n\n\nThe Balancer\u2019s Pool Hack\n\n\nIn January 2021, \nan issue allowed\n an attacker to steal cash from two pools containing tokens with lots of transfer fees.\u00a0This issue happened despite Balancer\u2019s frequent caution about unforeseen consequences surrounding ERC-20 with transfer fees in its discord, docs, and other channels.\n\n\nThe Balancer platform is built for ERC-20-compliant tokens. When these tokens act unusually and unexpectedly, there will always be negative consequences. In concluding this event, Balancer reimbursed liquidity providers who lost funds.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nBalancer is a convenient protocol for crypto investors who wish to exchange digital assets at optimal prices or have idle portfolios they would like to leverage.\n\n\nPrivate liquidity pools on the platform are standout features that portfolio managers and large-scale investors may find useful. Multi-token pools offer access to a solid index of cryptos that can rebalance automatically.\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL OFFER (Sponsored)\n\n\nBinance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive): \nUse this link\n to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance\n (\nfull details\n).\n\nLIMITED OFFER 2024 at BYDFi Exchange: Up to $2,888 welcome reward, \nuse this link\n to register and open a 100 USDT-M position for free!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
