These bad actors essentially take the money and run, leaving behind a worthless asset of their making.\u00a0\n\n\nTypically, a rug pull begins with the creation of a new cryptocurrency token that gets listed on a decentralized exchange and paired with a coin from a leading platform, such as Ethereum. Fraudsters then utilize the marketing powers of social media, launching a buzz-worthy, hype-filled promotional campaign across a myriad of channels to bait a community of investors. These scams often dangle empty promises of too-good-to-be-true yields or assign membership in the likes of a Ponzi scheme. With enough traction, a platform\u2019s reach increases alongside its token\u2019s value. Once the price peaks, the core development team dumps its share of the tokens, making its way out with the treasury of investor funds.\n\n\nExecuting a rug pull often involves exploiting a \nblockchain\u2019s\n \nsmart contract\n functionality. Here, developers may \nexploit\n self-executing programs responsible for transaction verification \nby using nefarious code, literally writing traps into a project\u2019s programming.\n\n\nGauging by the impact of investment fraud, rug pulls are quite common. Over the course of 2021, \nscammers rug pulled\n a total of $2.8 billion, or $7 million per day, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.\u00a0\n\n\nAdding distrust in a market already \nplagued by volatility\n, con artists are part of what categorizes crypto \u2014 and the DeFi ecosystem at large \u2014 as a digital Wild West.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out who's \nhiring\n.\n\n\nSee all \nData + Analytics\n jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat Does a Rug Pull Scheme Look Like?\n\n\n\u201cThe defining feature of a rug pull is the decision by the developers to abandon the project and take the funds while the investors still believe that the developers are working hard to make the project succeed,\u201d said Ruadhan O, a software engineer and the lead developer of multi-token crypto project Seasonal Tokens, who, like many crypto founders, uses a \npseudonym\n due to security concerns. (For example: A manager at a crypto firm \nwas abducted\n and held for ransom in 2017.)\n\n\nRug pulls are decked out in bells and whistles \u2014 a trail of social media hype and fancy graphics designed to bamboozle inexperienced investors, without any real follow-through when it comes to innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes this has been planned from the beginning of a project, and sometimes the developers become convinced at a later stage that a project will fail.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis list of red flags begins with unknown or anonymous project leaders, a barren, low-quality website and a guarantee of high returns. Lofty goals to be completed in an unreasonably short timeframe may decorate a startup\u2019s homepage, accompanied by suspicious social media activity, littered with buzzwords and a desperate sense of urgency.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile both a rug pull and a failed project arrive at the same destination, the routes are decidedly different. Developers of an honest startup will put investor funds toward a company\u2019s growth in accordance with its white paper, a document that outlines the procedure and purpose of a project, providing updates to investors every step of the way. Despite a team\u2019s best enterprising efforts, many projects fail without dishonest intervention. The \nlatest numbers\n from the U.S. Labor Statistics have it that only 80 percent of new businesses outlive their first year. Within five years, the survival rate for startups halves.\n\n\nIn contrast to a project that simply tanked, a rug pull doesn\u2019t set out to create anything. Its inherent purpose is to fool investors for profit.\n\n\n\u201cDevelopers consciously decide to abandon a project before the investors understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Ruadhan O said. \u201cSometimes this has been planned from the beginning of a project, and sometimes the developers become convinced at a later stage that a project will fail despite previous honest attempts to make it succeed.\u201d\n\n\nMost Successful Rug Pulls in Crypto History:\nOneCoin:\n A crypto-ponzi scheme allegedly duped more than three million of its members out of $4 billion from 2014 to 2016 fronted by Bulgaria-based company OneCoin. To date, it is the largest amount stolen in crypto history. The person allegedly \ntied to the theft\n earned a spot on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List after her disappearance in 2017, BBC reported.\u00a0\nAfricrypt:\n A $3.6 billion attack took down South African crypto investment platform Africrypt in 2021. Founding brothers Raees and Ameer Cajee \nhave denied any involvement\n after fleeing to the UK, according to Bloomberg.\u00a0\nGainBitcoin:\n After convincing investors they would receive monthly returns on their Bitcoin tokens, creators behind Indian-based company GainBitcoin allegedly ran with an estimated 385,000 to 600,000 bitcoin, or $3 billion to $4.7 billion at the time of theft. Over 200 victims \nhave teamed up\n in a Bitcoin Legal Defense lawsuit against the release of the accused, Ajay Bhardwaj, according to Delhi-based media outlet Inc 42.\nBitConnect:\n Now defunct England-based lending platform BitConnect promised investors guaranteed returns despite volatility in the market. Instead, founder Satish Kumbhani was allegedly paying off early investors with the money that came in from later investors, ultimately benefiting from $2.4 billion in global profit. \nCNN reported\n that Kumbhani could be facing up to 70 years in prison.\u00a0\nPlusToken:\n Over the course of a year, creator Bo Chen and his team allegedly siphoned $2.25 billion worth from primarily South Korean and Chinese investors in their global wallet and exchange platform. \nA court sentenced\n its top operators to serve 11 years in jail and pay nearly $1 million in fines, according to CoinGeek.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nComparitech\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTypes of Rug Pulls\n\n\nRug pulls come in two main varieties: hard and soft. As the name implies, a hard rug pull occurs suddenly, without signs of warning. The numbers crash to zero and all tokens immediately lose their value, letting investors know that they\u2019ve been defrauded and that the creators have deserted the project. Alternatively, developers might want to drag their plans out for a bit. In a soft pull, developers play the long game, selling a phony public image dedicated to a project\u2019s enduring success along with their share of the coins.\n\n\nRegardless of the pace of a hustle, rug pulls span three categories: liquidity stealing, limiting sell orders and dumping.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity Stealing\n\n\nThe most common of exit schemes, liquidity stealing, is when token creators extract all of the coins invested, or pooled, into a project. DeFi trading platforms require a collection of crypto tokens in order to facilitate actions such as trades, exchanges or loans, which are successfully secured via smart contracts. This safeguard is easily breached however when the developers who designed the security system did so with malicious intent, allowing them privileged access to the locked funds upon exit. Fully compromised, the native token loses its value, crashing to zero.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLimiting Sell Orders\n\n\nA more covert tactic involves blocking or limiting a users\u2019 ability to sell coins on a trading platform, which can be manipulated at any point in time. Once an exchange has attracted a substantial amount of traffic, backend fraudsters may amend a project\u2019s code to only grant traders the ability to buy into a platform. Meanwhile, selling of the native token is disabled\u00a0\n\u2014 either partially or entirely \u2014 across all but malicious accounts, effectively pouring money into the wallets of corrupt developers. Rug pull tactics that specifically manipulate smart contract technology to funnel money one way are virtual traps known as honeypots.\n\n\nWhether scammers choose to cap sale amounts or rewrite code that wholly reconfigures a native token\u2019s viability, the end goal will always be to run with the highest amount possible.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDumping\n\n\nAlso known as \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d schemes, these rug pulls operate off of fabricated public hype, often fueled by social media. Their aim is to lure swaths of eager crypto investors, enlisted to balloon the value of a shiny new token tied to a trending, up-and-coming project. At the optimal time, developers unload their shares and jump ship, plummeting the token\u2019s value for remaining investors caught off guard.\n\n\nMore on How to Evade FinTech Scams: \n8 Ways to Avoid 7 NFT Scams\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHow to Avoid Rug Pulls\n\n\nCharlton Haupt went \u201call in\u201d on crypto in 2017 after reading Bitcoin\u2019s white paper, quickly progressing from an investor to a trader shortly thereafter. Now serving as CEO to his own Web3 startup, \nBad Astro Society\n, an NFT project paving a path to launch its 10,000 members into space, Haupt humbly looks back on his early crypto career fumbles as essential learning curves. He, too, fell victim to rug pulls \u2014 more than he\u2019d like to count.\n\n\n\u201cEach time a project turned out to be a rug pull, I was thankful that I only put in what I was willing to have go to zero,\u201d he said. In that same year Haupt entered the crypto space, crowdfunding promotions known as \ninitial coin offerings boomed\n during an era he lovingly dubbed \u201cthe ICO craze of 2017.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach time a project turned out to be a rug pull, I was thankful that I only put in what I was willing to have go to zero.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOne happened so fast it was obvious that the founders just took the money and ran, he said. Another was a slow rug pull, which became evident over time as the team breadcrumbed communication until finally it hit a full stop. In fear of missing out, Haupt kept investing. The next time it wasn\u2019t a rug pull, but rather a startup en route to collapse. Still, he counted his blessings \u2014 at least, in this case, the team stayed transparent and kept its community privy as the ship sank.\n\n\n\u201cI still have a few tokens from projects that I [bought] into when I first started trading that have since gone to zero,\u201d he said. \u201cI still look at them in my wallet from time to time as a reminder to be patient and do my due diligence.\u201d\n\n\nOnward and upward, Haupt did what he had to do \u2014 the same he\u2019d preach to any crypto enthusiast aspiring to build a robust portfolio:\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShake it off, learn from your mistakes and you'll make it back,\u201d he advised. \u201cOver time, I have done just that.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExpert Tips\n\n\nAs rug pulls, honeypots and countless other schemes plundered the 2017-2018 bull market, the term \u201ccrowdfunding\u201d \u2014 which once spurred excitement for eager crypto investors \u2014 has since developed a bad reputation sealed in skepticism.\u00a0\n\n\nSoftware engineer and project coordinator Claudiu Minea hopes to change that with a company he co-founded, \nSeedOn\n, a crowdfunding platform that employs an intensive validation process in its alternative approach to conventional methods. Here are Minea\u2019s top tips:\n\n\n\n\nInvest in projects that have had their code audited by certified companies\n. Before handing over any money, it\u2019s important to vet the team behind a project in order to evaluate that they are even qualified to fulfill the company\u2019s vision.\n\n\nOnly consider projects that have the liquidity locked for a certain period of time\n. When liquidity is locked, it renounces the ownership of tokens in the liquidity pool for a fixed amount of time. Without ownership, developers cannot retrieve the pooled funds, instilling investor confidence as it closes the opportunity for developers\u2019 to escape with their money.\u00a0\n\n\nAlways question a company\u2019s intentions.\n Make sure that what the company sets out to achieve is feasible and try to invest in startups that provide utility tokens for an instant return on investment.\n\n\nVerify that the team behind the project is actively engaged with its platform\u2019s community.\n This should include consistent updates sharing the project\u2019s progress in a transparent manner. Results should reflect a trajectory as outlined in its white paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
