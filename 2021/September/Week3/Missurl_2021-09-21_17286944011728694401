In addition to being costly, it can decrease employee morale and create an unstable business environment as well as undermine business and consumer relationships.\n\n\nAccording to a study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the typical organization\u00a0loses five percent of revenues to fraud each year.\n\n\nUnfortunately, fraud in a business can go undetected for a long time and is often hard to uncover.\n\n\nBlockchain can be used to fight and prevent fraud in a business network.\n\n\nOne of the major components that determines the value of blockchain is its ability to share data in a fast and very secured way without any one entity having to take responsibility for safeguarding the data.\n\n\nEnhanced security is a leading benefit of blockchain technology.\n\n\nThe enhanced security offered by blockchain stems from how the technology actually works: Blockchain creates an unalterable record of transactions with end-to-end encryption, which shuts out fraud and unauthorized activities. Additionally, data on the blockchain is stored across a network of computers, making it nearly impossible to hack (unlike conventional computer systems that stores data together in servers). Furthermore, blockchain can address private concerns better than traditional computer systems by anonymizing data and requiring permissions to limit access.\n\n\nTransactions recorded on blockchain are immutable because they cannot be deleted or changed. Before a \u201cblock\u201d of transactions can be appended to the blockchain, network participants must agree the transaction is valid through a process called consensus.\n\n\nAccording to Casey Evans, blockchain expert and professor of finance and accounting at American University\u2019s Kogod School of Business, blockchain technology can help fraud detection because it enables\u00a0the sharing of information in real-time and all participants in a blockchain have visibility over transactions.\n\n\nThere are several methods fraudsters use to conceal their criminal activities, including altering or deleting information in a company\u2019s accounting systems, changing electronic or paper documents and creating fraudulent files. Using a shared digital ledger can help reduce fraud because it increases the visibility and transparency of the transactions made throughout a supply chain and between members of a business network. Participants can see the history and transfer of assets, so fraudulent transactions are easier to identify. Plus, to tamper with the transaction records on a blockchain, an individual or group of individuals in collusion would have to control a majority of the system.\n\n\nAnother beautiful attribute of blockchain technology that aid it in preventing fraud is the fact that blockchain can be permissioned.\n\n\nAlthough, not all blockchain can be permissioned. However, permissioned networks can be great for fraud prevention because they restrict who is allowed to participate and in what capacity. Members of a permissioned network must be invited and validated before they can contribute.\n\n\nControlling\u00a0access and identity management\u00a0are key in a permissioned network. With\u00a0Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain implementation framework hosted by the Linux Foundation, participants are issued cryptographic membership cards to represent their identity.\u00a0This makes it extremely hard for fraudulent activities to take place.\n\n\nApplication of blockchain technology can help make business networks less susceptible to fraud.\n\n\n\n"
