So while I\u2019m warning you with the name, I\u2019m going to list a few things the developers said during their time creating the Pok\u00e9mon on bsc rugpull, this may help you avoid a possible rug pull from the same team again in the future.\nThe pre sale was huge.\nThey were selling \"beta passes\" promising people the chance to be the first to play by paying for these passes.\nkept their identity a secret, while some other teams do this in legit project, this was a red flag that everyone accepted as Nintendo would likely try to take action against any fan made Pok\u00e9mon game, so while this is a cause for concern when looking into projects in general, it\u2019s not always a certain sign of a rugpull, but again, be aware, if you stumble across another Pok\u00e9mon on bsc project, if they haven\u2019t doxxed then look for all other signs before investing, proceed with a lot of caution.\nThey claimed they did not solely have control of all the wallets, and that each memeber of the team could access different wallets meaning one couldn\u2019t run away with all the funds, I mean this doesn\u2019t matter when it turns out they all ran away with the funds together.\nPromised a base game that would have expansions added for different Pok\u00e9mon regions & monsters.\nNow this next part please don\u2019t get confused, they claimed they would use Olympus, which is a project that would have allowed them to lock liquidity and it would give anyone the authority to view how much, and at what rate these funds are used, Olympus as far as we are aware, are NOT part of this rugpull, they seem like a genuine project that I feel may have alot of potential, so please do not send anger in their direction without any proof, they plan to have features in the future that will make people lock liquidity instantly as the presales are ongoing to stop these kinds of rugpulls being able to use their platform again.\nOlympus have also contacted people about tracking down the team behind the Pok\u00e9mon on bsc project, so they seem to be helping and I have a feeling they personally invested into this rugpull and got hit just like every other investor.\nThe team behind the pokemon rugpull also sounded like they were from the USA and one said that\u2019s where they lived, however this could have been a lie, they also mentioned they didn\u2019t like the new Pok\u00e9mon games so based their project around the older style games.\nThey had a white paper that I thought personally, looked abit to much into the future, with set dates for updates upto 2023, setting plans that far ahead of time to me may signal a red flag sometimes, as game development is a long process and it would be impossible to plan that far ahead of time with any real accuracy.\nThey also had on the website, a land demo that you could use to run around and view details about the game, this was built with unity.\nIf any of this sounds familiar, especially if you heard it when researching a Pok\u00e9mon project, then my best advice would be to stay clear.\nWhen investing in pre sales, I only ever use a small percentage of profits I\u2019ve made from my crypto adventures, rug pulls can be commonplace, especially in play to earn gaming right now, so I would never risk that cash you worked hard for, obviously this is just my personal opinion, but I urge you to be as careful as you can.\nMost of us that take risks with presales on projects we think could become massive, will get hit with a rugpull eventually, this is just a fact of the crypto space, but by being careful and doing research, you can avoid most, unfortunately for me, this was my first time being hit, if you have been affected by a rugpull then let\u2019s just remember the best advice for cryptocurrency in general..\nNever invest more then you are willing to lose.\nIf you can\u2019t live without the money, Do not invest it into any cryptocurrency project.\nEven if it\u2019s extremely unlikely, when I invest anything into cryptocurrency I always plan for it to goto zero. I never intend to need a single penny that I invest, this way it will not affect your real life situation in a negative way if things do go south.\nOn a positive note, remember we are the early adopters in not only blockchain gaming, but cryptocurrency in general, and hopefully we will all be much better of financially because of this."
