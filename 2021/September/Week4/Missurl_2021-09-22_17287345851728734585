With the increasing reliance on technology and data, it becomes very important to reinforce security measures to protect digital data and transactions. Cyberattacks can be carried out using various malware such as viruses, Trojans, Rootkits, etc. Some common types of cyberattacks are Phishing, Man in a middle (MITM) attack, Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, SQL injection, and Ransomware attacks.\n\n\nKey Cybersecurity Features:\n\n\n\n\nCryptographic checksums.\n\n\nData backup and data correction codes.\n\n\nAssess threats and risks.\n\n\nTake measures to restrain vulnerabilities in systems.\n\n\nUnderstanding malicious software.\n\n\nAccess control.\n\n\nAuthentication.\n\n\nEncryption.\n\n\nImplementing Firewalls.\n\n\nUse of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS and IPS).\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Blockchain?\n\n\nBlockchain\n is a shared, decentralized, and digital ledger that records transactions in the form of blocks. This ledger helps to store information transparently due to its property of immutability and access to allowed members only.\n\n\nKey Blockchain Features:\n\n\n\n\nDistributed shared ledger.\n\n\nImmutable records.\n\n\nDecentralized consensus mechanisms.\n\n\nSmart contracts.\n\n\nCryptographic key pair.\n\n\nIdentity and access management.\n\n\nEnhanced security.\n\n\nPeer to peer network.\n\n\nTraceability and transparency in transactions.\n\n\nNo central authority or need for trusted third-party involvement.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Blockchain Use Cases For Cybersecurity\n\n\n\n\nIoT security: \nWith the increasing application of AI and \nIoT\n, the security of data and systems from hackers has always been a major concern. Usage of Blockchain for improved security by using device-to-device encryption to secure communication, key management techniques, and authentication is a potential use case to maintain cybersecurity in the IoT system.\n\n\nThe integrity of software downloads:\n Blockchain can be utilized to verify updates and installers to prevent malicious software from infecting the devices. Here, hashes are recorded in the blockchain and new software identities can be compared to the hashes to verify the integrity of the downloads.\n\n\nData transmission protection:\n By using encryption, the data in transit will be protected from unauthorized access.\n\n\nDecentralized storage of critical data:\n With the exponentially increasing data generated every day, blockchain-based storage solutions help achieve decentralized storage thus protecting digital information.\n\n\nMitigating DDoS Attacks:\n One of the most popular cyberattacks today is DDoS attacks where hackers aim to generate a flood of Internet traffic and thus disrupt the flow of services. The properties of immutability and cryptography help Blockchain prove to be an effective solution for these attacks.\n\n\nDNS security: \nThe \nDomain Name System (DNS)\n is similar to a public directory that links domain names to their IP addresses. Over time, hackers have tried to access the DNS and exploit these links thus crashing sites. Due to Blockchain\u2019s properties of immutability and decentralized systems, the DNS can be stored with enhanced security.\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Blockchain in Cybersecurity\n\n\nIn cybersecurity, the CIA triad model acts as a reference to assess the security model of an organization. The triad consists of-\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality\n\n\nIntegrity\n\n\nAvailability\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain helps us ensure all these policies are satisfied.\n\n\n1. Confidentiality: \nIt means to ensure that only interested and authorized parties access the appropriate data. Full encryption of blockchain data ensures that the data will not be accessible by unauthorized parties while flowing through untrusted networks. Security measures such as access controls should be implemented directly at the application level so as to prevent attacks from within the network. Blockchain can provide advanced security controls by using public key infrastructure to authenticate parties and encrypt their communication. However backup storage of private keys in secondary storage poses theft of private keys as a high risk. To prevent this, key management procedures such as IETF or RFC and cryptographic algorithms based on integer factorization problems should be implemented.\n\n\n2. Integrity: \nBlockchains built-in characteristics of immutability and traceability help organizations ensure data integrity. Consensus model protocols can further help organizations to implement mechanisms to prevent and control ledger splitting in the event of a 51% cyber control attack. In Blockchain, with every new iteration, the previous state of the system is stored thus providing a fully traceable history log. Smart contracts can be used to verify and enforce rules between parties preventing miners from mining blocks of data.\n\n\n3. Availability: \nIn recent times, cyberattacks attempting to impact technology services availability are on the surge with DDoSs being the most common types of attacks. However, in blockchain-based systems, DDoS attacks are costly as the attacker attempts to overpower the network with a great number of small transactions. Blockchains have no single point of failure which decreases the chances of IP-based DDoS attacks disrupting the normal operation. Data remains available through various nodes and thus full copies of the ledger can be accessed at all times. The combination of multiple nodes and distributed operation makes the platforms and systems resilient.\n\n\nPros of Using Blockchain in Cybersecurity\n\n\n\n\nUser confidentiality: \nThe public key cryptography in a Blockchain network helps maintain the confidentiality of the users.\n\n\nData transparency and traceability: \nA history of all these transactions is maintained and thus can be traced anytime. The transactions data is digitally signed by members of the Blockchain network thus maintaining transparency.\n\n\nSecure data storage and processing: \nBlockchain\u2019s major feature of immutability and records of any changes to the data help store the data in a safe and secure manner.\n\n\nNo single point failures: \nBlockchain systems are decentralized and thus a single node failure doesn\u2019t affect the entire network. Thus even during DDoS attacks, the system is not compromised due to the maintenance of multiple copies of ledgers. This advantage is not possible for Private blockchains.\n\n\nSafe data transfers: \nThe Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in Blockchain maintains authentication during data transfers. Smart contracts help with the automatic execution of agreements between two parties during a transfer.\n\n\n\n\nCons of Using Blockchain in Cybersecurity\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nReliance on private keys: \nBlockchains rely heavily on Private Keys for encryption of data but these private keys cannot be recovered once lost. This may lead to losing access to encrypted data forever.\n\n\nAdaptability and scalability challenges: \nBlockchain networks have preset block volume and limits to transactions per second so it becomes very important to check the scalability of the network. Integrating Blockchain technology requires a complete replacement of the current systems and thus companies may face difficulties in doing so.\n\n\nHigh operating costs: \nBlockchain requires high computing power and storage capabilities. This leads to higher costs as compared to non-Blockchain applications.\n\n\nLack of governance: \nBlockchain concepts aren\u2019t regulated globally yet. Regulations and frameworks need to be developed in order to maintain governance in Blockchain applications.\n\n\nBlockchain literacy: \nLearning Blockchain technology requires a profound knowledge of various development, programming languages, and other tools. Thus in spite of numerous applications of Blockchain Technology, enough Blockchain developers are not available in the present scenario.\n\n\n\n\nReal-Life\n Application Examples\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing are some prominent examples where Blockchain is used for Cybersecurity:\n\n\n\n\nBarclays (London, England), Traditional Banking: \nBarclays have filed a patent to use blockchain to enhance security in fund transfers.
