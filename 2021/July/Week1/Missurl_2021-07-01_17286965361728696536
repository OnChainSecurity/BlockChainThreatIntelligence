        "original_content": "As the crypto market matures, the need for cross-network liquidity increases \u2014\u00a0 THORChain aims to fill that gap. Built as a cross-chain liquidity network using the Cosmo SDK, it strives to make all crypto liquid and decentralized with its native token RUNE serving as a trading token between non-native crypto assets like \nBTC\n and \nETH\n. Broadly speaking, THORChain does exactly what Binance, Coinbase, and other exchanges do but without a third-party ever getting involved.\nTHORChain was founded back in 2018 by a mostly anonymous team during a hackathon, the protocol\u2019s mainnet release multi-chain chaos network (MCCN) went live in April 2021 after initial development testing. Unlike \nUniswap\n, \nSushiSwap\n, and \nCurve\n, THORChain is not limited to just ERC-20 or BEP-20 tokens, instead, you can swap between different blockchains with relatively low costs and high speeds, all through a decentralized exchange (DEX).\u00a0\nRUNE price\nAccording to our RUNE/USD live price chart, THORChain saw its first bull run in Q1 of 2021, when RUNE went from under $0.9 in December 2020 to a peak of around $6.7 on March. 11, 2021 \u2014 a gain of over 700%. Although RUNE hit a rough patch for a couple of days during March, it saw another rally that took it from $4.9 on March. 25, 2021 to $21.2 by May. 19, 2021, setting an all-time high with a rather impressive gain of 350%+ in just 55 days. At the time, RUNE's fully diluted valuation stood at $10.6 billion given the token's max supply of 500,000,000.\nHowever, as the market sentiment grew bearish in May 2021, RUNE saw a steep decline in the coming months.\nTHORChain saw some noteworthy price action between July and November 2021, as the price of RUNE cryptocurrency rallied from $4.8 on July. 22, 2021, to around $17.2 by Nov. 2, 2021.\nDespite the market falling in Q4 of 2021 and continuing this downward spiral into 2022, RUNE managed to stay within the top 50 coins by market cap in Q2 2022, while trading around $8.\nHow RUNE works\nAt its core, THORChain RUNE is an independent Layer-1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism, allowing the network to reach a consensus even if \u2153 of the nodes start failing.\nIt also employs the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism for Sybil resistance. This means the blockchain is secured by node operators also known as validators who authorize swaps and in return earn rewards for creating pools or vaults for assets.\u00a0\nAn asset is sent to a pool or vault when a swap is made on the THORChain blockchain. To ensure the swap is made and the designated address receives the coins, Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) is used, where \u2154 of nodes confirm that the transaction was successful.\u00a0\nThere are 100 to 300 node operator spots. These spots are recycled regularly in a process called \u201cchurning\u201d, where sets of nodes are switched every 50,000 blocks, which is roughly around 3 days to avoid any bad nodes taking over the network and capturing it.\u00a0\nTo be eligible for a spot on the THORChain blockchain, nodes must bond (i.e stake) $1 million RUNE coins. Nodes that act accordingly are rewarded a portion of the protocol\u2019s income, while bad nodes lose their bonded RUNE coins.\u00a0\nTHORChain (RUNE) protocol also uses the AMM (Automated market makers) model. AMMs are DEXs that pool liquidity from users and generate prices based on the respective amount of each asset held inside the pool. Liquidity providers are granted a small portion of the fee paid by traders while receiving RUNE rewards for depositing RUNE and one other asset to the liquidity pool.\nRUNE news, updates, and highlights\nIn April 2021, ShapeShift, an international non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange \nannounced\n that it had enabled cross-chain swaps via THORChain and Ethereum-based DEX trading on their web platform.\u00a0\nFounder and CEO of ShapeShift, Erik Voorhees, said, \u201cWe are very excited to offer users more options for trading in the manner they prefer\u2014be it on mobile, web, software wallet or hardware wallet, ETH or native BTC, while at the same time providing the best incentives available in DEX trading\u201d.\u00a0\nThe company also added RUNE to its KeepKey and ShapeShift native wallets.\u00a0\nTHORChain RUNE suffered a massive security breach in July 2021, when a hacker tricked the network\u2019s Bifrost protocol into receiving fake assets on the ETH Router with a custom contract. This cost the company $8 million and \nresulted\n in the immediate halting of ETH activity on the THORChain blockchain.\u00a0 Just a week prior to this incident, THORChain suffered another attack which resulted in the loss of 4k ETH from the crypto trading protocol.\nRUNE cryptocurrency saw a surge in price in March 2022, when it decided to\n integrate\n Terra (LUNA) into the THORChain protocol and Cosmos ecosystem, giving users more trading and staking options.THORChain also hinted at an upcoming mainnet launch and was also considering offering liquidity providers more generous returns.\nFrequently asked questions about RUNE\nTHORChain is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, which means it cannot be mined but can be staked. Users can stake their RUNE tokens to generate yield or vote on the governance of a protocol. Liquidity providers can stake their assets in pools to collect fees when trades are made on the network by other users.\nTHORWallet DEX is the only native non-custodial wallet for RUNE. Available as a mobile app, it lets you earn passive income by swapping native cryptos across chains. Trust Wallet and XDEFI Wallet are also some other popular options. If you are in search of hardware wallets then Ledger Nano S, Ledger Nano X and Trezor are suitable options.\nRUNE tokens can be used for governance, so as to activate pools with the most liquidity. The RUNE token is also used to reward nodes and incentivize them to secure the network. Liquidity Providers also receive incentives or swap commissions in RUNES.\nYou can buy THORChain RUNE on centralized exchanges like HitBTC, with trading pair RUNE/BTC, and MEXC, with trading pair RUNE/USDT. However, you can also buy RUNE using fiat currency on exchanges like Binance."
