These expensive problems are spurring a drive for greater efficiency and innovation.\n\n\nHow Can Blockchain Be Used in Healthcare?\nBlockchain\u2019s distributed ledger technology facilitates the secure transfer of patient medical records, strengthens healthcare data defenses, manages the medicine supply chain and helps healthcare researchers unlock genetic code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its ability to deflate the current spending bubble, protect \npatient data\n and improve the overall healthcare experience, \nblockchain\n in healthcare may help ease the pain. The technology is already being used to do everything from securely encrypting patient data to managing the outbreak of harmful diseases.\n\n\nThese 16 \nexamples of blockchain\n in healthcare are creating a more seamless experience for patients and healthcare professionals alike.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\n\n3 Ways Blockchain Will Change Healthcare | Video: The Medical Futurist\n\n\nBlockchain and Healthcare Data Security\n\n\nIn 2023, there were \n725 data breaches\n of at least 500 patient records \u2014 the most ever reported to the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. \nBlockchain\u2019s ability\n to keep an incorruptible, decentralized and transparent log of all patient data makes it a technology \nideal for security applications\n. Blockchain uses complex codes to protect sensitive medical data and conceal the identity of any individual. Its\u00a0\ndecentralized nature\n also allows patients, doctors and healthcare providers to share the same information quickly and safely.\n\n\nCheck out how these five companies apply blockchain to healthcare data security.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy implementing the Electronic Patient Interactive Device, or\u00a0\nePID\n, into clinical trials, \nNovo Nordisk\n aims to make patient data collection both more convenient and more secure. Software engineers at the company have implemented blockchain technology into ePID\u2019s data collection capabilities to ensure medical information isn\u2019t breached or altered in any way, thereby securing the integrity of the clinical trial process.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAkiri\n operates a network-as-a-service specifically for the healthcare industry, helping protect transportation of patient health data. The Akiri system does not store data of any kind. It operates as both a network and a\u00a0\nprotocol to set policies\n and configure data layers while verifying the sources and destinations of data in real time. Akiri ensures healthcare data remains secure and shareable with only the parties authorized for access at the moment they need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBurstIQ\n\u2019s platform helps healthcare companies safely and securely manage massive amounts of patient data. Its blockchain technology enables the safekeeping, sale, sharing or licensing of data while maintaining strict\u00a0\ncompliance with HIPAA rules\n. Because BurstIQ\u2019s platform includes complete and up-to-date information about patients\u2019 health and healthcare activity, it could help to root out abuse of opioids or other prescription drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicalchain\n\u2019s blockchain maintains the integrity of health records while establishing a single point of truth. Doctors, hospitals and laboratories can all request patient information that has a record of origin and protects the patient\u2019s identity from outside sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGuardtime\n is helping healthcare companies and governments implement blockchain in their\u00a0\ncybersecurity\n methods. The company was vital in helping implement blockchain in Estonia\u2019s healthcare systems, and it\u00a0\nsigned a deal\n with a private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to bring blockchain to its data privacy systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\nBlockchain and IoT: 10 Examples Making Our Future Smarter\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain Medical Records\n\n\nAbout 25 percent of U.S. healthcare spending is \nconsidered wasteful\n due to services that don\u2019t have clear benefits, are harmful or could be replaced with cheaper alternatives. The process of accessing a patient\u2019s medical records exhausts staff resources and delays patient care. Blockchain-based medical records create one ecosystem of patient data that can be efficiently referenced by healthcare professionals and institutions. In this way, the blockchain can lead to better diagnoses and personalized care plans.\u00a0\n\n\nThese three companies embrace the concept of blockchain medical records to create shared databases and personalized health plans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAvaneer\n is a company backed by Aetna, CVS Health, Cleveland Clinic and other healthcare leaders that is dedicated to using\u00a0\nblockchain technology\n to improve healthcare efficiency. Avaneer uses a public ledger to support better claims processing, secure healthcare data exchanges and keep provider directories up-to-date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProCredEx\n has created a distributed ledger of healthcare credentials data that boosts complex dataset efficiency by rendering the data immutable and permanently traceable. It allows data to be curated to meet unique organizational requirements and shared with authorized partners. The platform uses proprietary validation engines and restricts memberships to vetted and approved organizations so health systems can rapidly acquire verified credentials and promote patient safety and care quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPatientory\n\u2019s \nend-to-end encryption\n ensures that patient data is shared safely and efficiently. The company\u2019s platform enables patients, healthcare providers and clinicians to access, store and transfer all important information via blockchain. Patientory helps the healthcare industry move more quickly by housing all patient information under one roof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlockchain and Medical Supply Chain Management\n\n\nBlockchain has serious implications for pharmaceutical \nsupply chain management\n, and its decentralization virtually guarantees full transparency in the shipping process. Once a ledger for a drug is created, it will mark the point of origin. The ledger will then continue to record data every step of the way, including who handled it and where it has been, until it reaches the consumer.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHere are five companies using blockchain to rethink the medical supply chain.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChronicled\n builds blockchain networks that demonstrate chain-of-custody. The networks help pharma companies make sure their medicines arrive efficiently, and they enable law enforcement to review any suspicious activity \u2014 like\u00a0\ndrug trafficking\n. Chronicled also created the \nMediledger Project\n, a ledger system dedicated to the safety, privacy and efficiency of medical supply chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmbleema\n is a virtual trial and regulatory analytics platform designed to fast-track drug development. Users are recruited to digitally consent to secure, untampered medical data collection, which is then stored on Embleema\u2019s blockchain and analyzed. Embleema\u2019s platform allows patients to assist in speeding up treatment availability and improving safety, all through the company\u2019s Virtual Suite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTierion\n\u2019s blockchain audits documents, records and medicines to keep a clear history of possession. The company uses timestamps and credentials to maintain \nproof of ownership\n throughout a medical supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSoluLab\n offers services to support companies with \nblockchain application development\n. For the healthcare industry in particular, SoluLab\u2019s solutions can help determine the authenticity of drugs and medical data by tracing their origin, as well as encrypting data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFarmaTrust\n\u2019s blockchain solutions have applications for tracking pharmaceuticals, determining the authenticity of medical devices, and maintaining data security for patients scheduling vaccinations and diagnostic testing. The company\u2019s services help keep\u00a0\nfake drugs\n out of the supply chain, for example, while also offering an app that lets consumers check whether medicines are genuine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBreakthroughs in Genomics\n\n\nGenome sequencing could cost\n about $1 million in 2007, but the price has since fallen to around $600. Blockchain is a perfect fit for this growing industry as it can safely house billions of genetic data points. It\u2019s even become a marketplace where people sell their encrypted genetic information to create a wider database, giving scientists access to valuable data faster than ever before.\u00a0\n\n\nThese three companies use blockchain to help us better understand the most basic building blocks of human life.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquiring doc.ai\n in 2021,\u00a0\nSharecare\n has capitalized on its enhanced engineering expertise and developed a decentralized research platform.
