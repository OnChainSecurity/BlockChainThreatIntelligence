        "original_content": "Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is behind the rash of bots performing arbitrage on cryptocurrency exchanges.\u00a0 They exploit the rules of the blockchain to make a profit at the expense of blockchain users.\nInside Block Creation\nMEV is made possible by the rules governing how blocks are created on the blockchain.\u00a0 Blockchain uses consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) to select a miner to create the next block in the chain.\u00a0 While this process can vary greatly, the goal is to have a single valid version of each block created.\nThe legitimate creator of a block has a great deal of autonomy regarding what they put in those blocks.\u00a0 Blockchains typically have the concept of transaction fees, which are paid by the account making a transaction to the creator of the block that adds it to the distributed ledger.\nTransactions do not have to be added to the blockchain in any order, and block creators are allowed (and expected) to be greedy about transaction fees.\u00a0 The higher the fee associated with a given transaction, the faster it will likely be added to the ledger.\nIntroducing MEV\nThe concept of MEV comes from the fact that block creators (called \u201cminers\u201d in Proof of Work or PoW blockchains) have the ability to order the transactions contained within a block that they create however they wish.\u00a0 They also have an incentive to maximize their profits in terms of the transaction fees paid to them.\nSome traders exploit these factors by creating bots that perform arbitrage across different cryptocurrency exchanges.\u00a0 When an imbalance exists between the price of an asset on different crypto exchanges, traders can make a profit by buying on one exchange and selling on another.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the ability to exploit these imbalances is dependent on how transactions are ordered within a block because the transactions that exploit the price imbalance also help to rebalance prices by redistributing the supply of the asset across exchanges.\nMEV comes into play here because these cryptocurrency bots enter into bidding wars to be the first to make these transactions.\u00a0 The transaction with the highest fee \u2013 or the one that the miner decides to include first \u2013 wins the race and makes the profit.\nMEV, Frontrunning, and DeFi Hacks\nMEV bots race to be the first to exploit imbalanced prices or \u201cslippage,\u201d and the best way to accomplish this is to exploit the slippage before it happens. Any large trade on a cryptocurrency exchange will cause some slippage because it changes the supply of the asset being traded.\nMEV bots exploit this by monitoring the blockchain network for transactions containing large trades that have not yet been added to a block.\u00a0 If a bot sees an upcoming buy, it will \nfrontrun\n the buy, decreasing the asset\u2019s supply and causing the price to go up.\u00a0 When the original trade goes through, supply decreases further and price increases even more.\u00a0 The bot can then sell its assets, making a tidy profit off of the trade.\nMEV bots have an impact on cryptocurrency arbitrage, but they\u2019re also showing up in DeFi hacks as well.\u00a0 A \nrecent hack against the DODO DEX\n was frontrun by a MEV bot, whose owner later returned the funds, decreasing the impact of the attack.\u00a0 And on July 31, 2021, a MEV bot \nwas exploited by a malicious smart contract\n in a targeted attack against vulnerable MEV scripts.\nMEV and Blockchain Security\nMEV can be extremely profitable to a trader, meaning that every transaction on many blockchains is monitored and potentially at risk of frontrunning by MEV bots.\u00a0 When performing transactions or developing contracts on blockchain platforms, it is important to consider the potential for \nfrontrunning\n and its impacts."
