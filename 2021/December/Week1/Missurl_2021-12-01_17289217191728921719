The hacker reportedly added a malicious script to the protocol\u2019s frontend website, prompting users to approve a smart contract transaction giving the script unlimited permission to drain funds from their wallets.\nBadgerDAO Suffers Frontend Attack\nBadgerDAO, a DeFi protocol with over 30,000 active users and $1.2 billion in total value locked, has been exploited.\nThe attack occurred early Wednesday. Soon after, many affected users reported suspicious outgoing transactions from their wallets.\nIt\u2019s suspected that the attacker exploited the protocol\u2019s frontend website rather than its smart contracts.\u00a0\nThe hacker allegedly inserted a malicious script on Badger\u2019s website that presented users with a transaction to \u201cincrease allowance,\u201d which gave the attacker unlimited permission to drain the funds users had deposited in the vaults if they approved the transaction.\u00a0\nBadgerDAO acknowledged the exploit earlier this morning. In a Twitter statement, the team confirmed that it had \u201creceived reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds.\u201d The team has paused the project\u2019s smart contracts and is currently investigating the issue.\u00a0\nAccording to on-chain data, the \nexploiter contract\n was created on Nov. 20. It appears that the attacker waited until multiple users had approved the contract before beginning to drain the funds all at once this morning.\u00a0\nCommenting on the exploit on the project\u2019s Discord server, Badger core contributor Tritium wrote:\n\u201cIt looks like a bunch of users had approvals set for the exploit address allowing [the address] to operate on their vault funds and that was exploited.\u201d\nSmart contract auditing firm Peckshield has \nestimated\n the total losses come to around $120 million. One user reportedly lost nearly 900 Bitcoin, currently worth around $50.7 million, in a single transaction.\u00a0\n\n\nSome users reportedly became aware of the exploit as far back as five days ago and escalated the issue with BadgerDAO developers. The team, however, seems to have largely ignored the issue. \nA screenshot\n posted by the Twitter user DeFi Ahab shows that a Discord member going by the name fewture alerted the team to the \u201cincrease allowance\u201d prompt, before Badger team member blackbear dismissed their concerns by saying it was most likely because \u201cthe UI got a bit bugged.\u201d\nAffected users have already created a Discord channel dedicated to tracking the hacker. The information posted suggests that the attacker made several transactions connected to the exploit that could be traced back to centralized exchanges with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. This would theoretically make the hacker easier to trace.\u00a0\nJudging by recent comments in the Discord channel, community members and Badger core contributors are confident that they\u2019ve already identified the attacker. Peckshield also appears to support this theory, \ntweeting\n that \u201cprogress has been made,\u201d around the same time information linked to the alleged hacker started appearing in the channel.\nDeFi has been hit other similar attacks in recent months, but this specific type of exploit, where the attacker has compromised a project\u2019s user interface rather than its \nsmart contracts\n, has rarely been seen on this magnitude. At $120 million lost, it\u2019s one of the biggest DeFi hacks to date.\nThe project\u2019s native token, BADGER, has been hit hard by the incident. It\u2019s down 17.5% today, trading at $22.05 at press time.\n\n\n\n"
