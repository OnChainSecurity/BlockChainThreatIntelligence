A \"hot wallet\" refers to crypto assets that are connected to the internet and more easily accessible to owners than offline \"cold wallets.\" While keeping cryptocurrency in a hot wallet is more convenient, there\u2019s an added risk of hacks such as the Bitmart breach.\n\n\nThe hack was first reported by blockchain security and data analytics firm Peckshield and was later confirmed by Bitmart CEO Sheldon Xia.\n\nAccording to Peckshield\u2019s analysis, unidentified hackers used a stolen private key to open the two wallets and extract funds. Peckshield claims the hackers could have stolen up to $196 million in assets. All Bitmart assets not held in these wallets are secure, according to the company.\n\n01 computer hacking STOCK\nShutterstock\nBitmart will use its own funding to cover losses and compensate impacted users. Crypto exchange Huobi Global came out in support of the company as it race to mitigate the hack. Huobi tweeted Monday that it will assist Bitmart by reporting and handling any incoming assets potentially originating from the hack.\n\nAll withdrawals from Bitmart were suspended Saturday. Xia tweeted Monday that deposit and withdrawal functions will be gradually restored beginning Tuesday.\n\nXia will conduct an AMA at 8 p.m. EST on Telegram Monday to share more information on the hack, compensation of users impacted and next steps in resuming business, according to the BitMart Twitter account."
