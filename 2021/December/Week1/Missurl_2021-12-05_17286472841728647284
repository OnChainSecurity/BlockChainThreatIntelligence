Here\u2019s how identify rugpulls and steer clear of such projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rugpull: the one thing investors fear the most in crypto. Yet, the words of Marvel\u2019s supervillain, Thanos rings true:\n\n\n\u201cDread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, unlike the inevitable devastating effects of the infinity stones, a rugpull can be avoided \u2013 you just have to identify the signs on time.\n\n\nSo, how can you tell if a project is on the path to a rugpull? And how do you get out before shit hits the fan?\n\n\nThe codes Never Lie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay all you want about the regulation of cryptocurrencies or the lack thereof, but it\u2019s all laid out in 0s and 1s \u2013 not black and white.\n\n\nIf it\u2019s a De-Fi project, the smart contract codes tell it all. You can tell if the project is here for the long term by looking at the smart contract codes.\n\n\nIf the contract has unverified codes, run. Those are usually done to keep unruly activities from the prying eyes of the community. For instance, a project with a capped token supply that has a minting function is a rekt-haven for investors.\n\n\nYou should also lookout for an ownership renounced contract. Projects that allow a contract owner to decide who gets what and how are certainly not to be trusted.\n\n\nLiquidity locking and time lock also help you to identify projects that have intentions of pulling the rug from under your feet. If liquidity isn\u2019t locked for a few months, the team isn\u2019t keen on building.\n\n\nTokenomics\n Is \nthe\n Key\n\n\nAll projects on the blockchain have their tokenomics. If they have a native token, the tokenomics serves as a guide on its use and misuse.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with a potential rekt project, tokenomicsisn\u2019t just about token distribution; it paints the true picture of the intention of the project. Likely candidates for rugpull don\u2019t put any value on their token. It\u2019s mostly marketing, burning, and sharing. If tokenomics points this out, it\u2019s your clue to take caution.\n\n\nKnow TheDevs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s common for blockchain developers to hide under the cloak of anonymity should in case things go south. Yet, that gives them the leeway to leave investors dazed with a rugpull. Projects that have Devs with a name and face are rare gems.\n\n\nThere are ways to confirm a project\u2019s devs are going to be pulling the plug anytime soon. If they\u2019re not accountable to the community, that\u2019s a big red flag.\n\n\nA lack of communication is another sign the Devs don\u2019t care about the project. Reassurances are crucial in the unregulated crypto space. If the team \u2013 Dev team especially \u2013 doesn\u2019t see a need to spoon-feed investors on the state of the project, then you should manage your risk accordingly.\n\n\n\n"
