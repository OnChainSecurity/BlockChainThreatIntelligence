        "original_content": "Last December\u2019s $77 million hacked from AscendEX, mostly in \nEthereum\n, \nBinance Smart Chain token\n, and \nMATIC\n, have started to get back in circulation.\u00a0\nHackers have begun moving some stolen crypto to decentralized exchange Uniswap, according to on-chain data first spotted by security research house PeckShield.\nEthereum Worth $1.5 Million Moved\nApproximately two months after the security breach on the crypto exchange AscendEx (formerly Bitmax), took place the anonymous hackers have started to transfer funds from the hack.\nFor now, around $1.5 million worth of Ethereum has been sent to Uniswap in their first attempts to launder the money.\nThe Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange suffered a hot wallet breach of $77.7 million, on December 13. As per early estimations, the total amount swiped during the security breach was close to about $80 million in Ethereum, Binance Coin, and MATIC.\nSoon after the hack, withdrawals had been suspended, as the exchange looked into the data of the breach promising that no customers will lose their digital assets. Further, the addresses that received the funds were blacklisted immediately, and there was little-to-no movement until recently.\nShedding light on the transfers, the blockchain security company PeckShield highlighted that there\u2019s activity coming from one of the Ethereum addresses. They further stated that the hackers sent roughly 516 Ethereum, worth $1.5 million to Uniswap in their first attempts to launder the funds.\nSince Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, it doesn\u2019t require any KYC, which means that the perpetrators can mix their coins and then transfer them to new addresses without being traced.\nIncreasing Crypto Crimes\nWhile crypto crimes and centralized exchange hacks are on the rise, the governing bodies are tightening their reach around such issues.\nFor instance, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) recently launched what seemed to be the largest financial seizure ever related to cryptocurrencies.\nStory continues\nThe authorities seized $3.6 billion worth of digital assets linked to a hack on the crypto exchange Bitfinex made in 2016, just a week back. Notably, over the last year, as digital assets gained traction, crypto criminals and hackers too reaped enormous earnings from the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis \narticle\n was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE:"
