        "original_content": "\n\nGoDaddy, a web hosting giant,\n \nannounced\n today its partnership with Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a prominent Web3 domain service, to allow over 20 million GoDaddy domain owners to directly link their domains to ENS without worrying about technical background or additional expenses.\nAccording to GoDaddy\u2019s\n \nblog post\n, the move aims to replace complex wallet addresses, often associated with long and complex strings of characters, with easily memorable domain names. To achieve this, GoDaddy has introduced a new DNS feature that enables quick linkage between GoDaddy\u2019s domain names and ENS-compatible crypto wallets, including popular options like Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, and Uniswap Wallet.\nHowever, transferring domain names to work with ENS used to be costly because of gas fees. To solve this, ENS has deployed new smart contracts that make it free to verify that you own a domain name and want it to be your crypto wallet name.\nThe result of this partnership is seamless, cost-free integration with domain names now serving as wallet addresses. Users can send and receive crypto across numerous blockchain applications using their preferred domain names.\nPaul Nicks, president of domains at GoDaddy, expressed his bullish outlook on the partnership. He said:\n\u201cAs a long-time domain industry steward, we are always looking for innovative enhancements that benefit our customers,\u201d said Nicks. \u201cPartnering with ENS presents our customers with a unique opportunity to experience the fusion of [domain] names and blockchain technologies, bringing some great benefits for users in both areas.\u201d\nNick Johnson, founder of ENS, echoed this sentiment, highlighting the importance of building a secure, decentralized, and user-friendly internet.\n\n\n\u201cBy pairing up ENS names and GoDaddy domains, we will streamline the way users interact with web domains, blending the familiarity of the DNS with the potential of blockchain technology,\u201d stated Johnson.\nIn 2022, GoDaddy and True Names Ltd., the company behind ENS, got into a legal dispute over the\n \neth.link domain name. True Names sued GoDaddy after they incorrectly declared the domain expired and sold it. The dispute resulted in a court injunction in favor of ENS, leading to the restoration of the eth.link domain\n. The case is ongoing, and the parties involved have made arguments and counterarguments in the \nlegal proceedings\n.\n\n\n\n"
