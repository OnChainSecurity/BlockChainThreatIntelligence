Gox that led to the company\u2019s bankruptcy and heightened regulation in the nascent space about seven years ago.\n\nSoon after the hack, Tether, the company behind the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, froze roughly $33 million in USDT tokens associated with the alleged hacker\u2019s wallet address, according to its chief technology officer.\n\nBlockchain-based security firm SlowMist also issued a statement hours after the attack, saying it had identified the attacker\u2019s email, IP address and device fingerprints, and was working on tracking additional identity clues.\n\nPoly, which was founded by the $3.3 billion Chinese cryptocurrency project NEO, did not immediately respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment.Update 8/11: Early Wednesday morning, hackers started returning a small amount of the stolen funds, with Poly retrieving nearly $5 million thus far.Crucial Quote \n\"We call on miners of affected blockchain and crypto exchanges to blacklist tokens coming from the above addresses,\" Poly Network tweeted Tuesday.\n\nTangent\nCrypto-exchange operators spoke out soon after the massive hack. Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in tweets that the company, which serves as the primary operator of the blockchain on which binance coins are built, will coordinate with its security partners and \"do as much as [it]can\" to help. Meanwhile, Jay Hao, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx,saidthe company is \"watching the flow of coins and will do [its] best to manage the situation.\"Big Number\n$103 billion. That\u2019s the current market value of all decentralized finance tokens (like Polygon), according to cryptodata website CoinGecko. The space shot past a $100 billion valuation for the first time ever this year and peaked at about $150 billion in May before the broader crypto market crashed nearly 50%. \n\nKey Background\nLess than a week before the Poly hack, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said booming decentralized finance platforms, also known as DeFi, deserve more government scrutiny. The platforms largely sidestep traditional intermediaries like central banks and exchanges for financial services and instead rely on blockchains-and often their own cryptocurrencies-to process transactions. Gensler said such practices can implicate securities, commodities and banking laws, and called on Congress to ramp up its authority over the cryptocurrency industry, which he likened to the \"Wild West.\" Meanwhile, institutional investors have largely been warming up to the space: Goldman Sachs last month filed to create its own exchange-traded fund investing in DeFi.
