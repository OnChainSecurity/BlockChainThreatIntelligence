Poly Network, a decentralized finance platform, had been robbed of more than $600 million in cryptocurrency through a code vulnerability earlier this month. But on Monday, the company said, every last virtual dime was returned.\n\nPoly Network is a decentralized finance platform, or defi, that works across blockchains. It lets people swap tokens across multiple blockchains, including popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the initial attack, the hacker stole $273 million of Ethereum tokens, $253 million in tokens on Binance Smart Chain and $85 million in USDC on the Polygon network, according to The Block. \n\nThe hacker, known as Mr. White Hat, began returning assets almost immediately after the theft was revealed, apparently moving funds piecemeal. On Monday morning, Poly Network was contacted by the hacker, who provided a private key to the remainder of the outstanding funds.\n\n\"At this point, all the user assets that were transferred during the incident have been fully recovered,\" the company reported in a Medium post on Monday. Poly Network said it's now working to return the assets to their owners.\n\nIt's not immediately clear why the hacker decided to return the money, but a message included in the digital currency transaction by an anonymous person claim to be the hack said they were \"[quitting] the show,\" according to CNBC.\n\n\"My actions, which may be considered weird, are my efforts to contribute to the security of the Poly project in my personal style,\" the hacker said in the message. \"The consensus was reached in a painful and obscure way, but it works.\n\nConsumers Lost $114 Million to Bitcoin ATM Scams in 2023, FTC Says\nHere's how to avoid getting ripped off by scammers looking to use Bitcoin ATMs to steal your cash.\n\n\nBree Fowler\nSept. 5, 2024 11:49 a.m. PT\n3 min read\n\nAn image of a hand feeding cash ito a Bitcoin ATM.\nScammers are stealing millions of dollars from consumers by getting them to turn their cash into Bitcoin.\nGetty\nConsumers lost $114 million to scams involving Bitcoin ATMs last year, amounting to a tenfold increase from just three years ago, according to a new report from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThis year's losses are on track to be even higher, with an estimated $65 million reported for the first six months of 2024 alone, the FTC said Tuesday. It also noted that since the vast majority of financial fraud goes unreported, the numbers likely represent just a small fraction of the actual amount of money lost to these kinds of crimes. \n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are designed to be largely anonymous and untraceable, which means that once they're in the hands of criminals there's almost always no way to get them back. That's made them the payment method of choice for online scammers and other kinds of cybercriminals.\n\nBitcoin ATMs take things a step further by giving the average person easy access to crypto. The terminals found in gas stations, stores and other busy locations. They often look like regular ATMs, but instead of dispensing cash, they allow consumers to exchange money for largely untraceable and easily transferable cryptocurrency. \n\nThe lies scammers tell aren't any different than those used in other kinds of financial scams and often start with an unsolicited email, text message or phone call that claim to have spotted suspicious activity or unauthorized charges on a victim's account. \n\nRead More:\nA Record $12.5 Billion Lost to Internet Crime in 2023\nScammers Look to Hook Vacation Shoppers With Phishing Emails\nAbout 1 Billion People Hit by Data Breaches in First Half of 2024\nThe scammers might pose as a tech company like Microsoft or Apple or falsely claim to be law enforcement or a federal agent, the FTC says. In any of those cases, their goal is to convince the victim that their money isn't safe and needs to be moved.\n\nThat's where the Bitcoin ATMs come in. The scammers will tell victims to take their money out of their bank accounts and direct them to a nearby Bitcoin ATM to deposit it, falsely claiming that this will either fix the problem with their account or keep their money safe. Sometimes they'll even refer to the ATMs as \"safety lockers,\" the FTC says.\n\nThey'll text the victim a QR code to scan at the machine. And once they do that, the cash -- now crypto -- is sent directly to the scammer's wallet and will most likely never be recovered.\n\nIndividual losses from these kinds of scams are often steep. For the first six months of this year, the median reported loss was $10,000, the FTC says. In addition, people 60 and older were more than three times as likely as younger people to report a loss in the first half of this year.\n\nHow to avoid getting scammed\nHere are some tips from the FTC and CNET for how to keep yourself from becoming the victim of a financial scam.\n\nIgnore unsolicited emails. This goes for text, messages sent through social media and phone calls too. If someone reaches out to you to say that one of your financial accounts has been compromised, don't respond or click on links in emails or texts. Instead, call your bank or credit card company directly. \n\nBe skeptical of urgency. If anyone for any reason says you need to send them money right away or move your money from your bank account, stop and think before you do. It's almost always a scammer. Even if you think it might be a legitimate communication, make some calls before you take action.\n\nCrypto payment requests are scams. Legitimate companies and financial institutions will never ask for payment in the form of crypto. And government officials will never ask you to move money to a crypto wallet to keep it safe. If someone tells you to do either of those things they're a scammer. On a related note, requests for payment in the form of gift cards are undoubtedly scams, too.\n\nReport scam messages. Most email programs have buttons that let you report spam or phishing. Scam text messages can be reported by forwarding them to 7726 (SPAM). "
