Although blockchain technology improves security by design, it is not immune to security threats and vulnerabilities. Ethereum, as a decentralized, open-source blockchain, has shown high growth and widespread adoption in recent years, however, there is a wide range of vulnerability, security risks, and also attacks around it. To tackle such issues, machine learning could be a viable solution for threat hunting in the Ethereum blockchain. Machine learning algorithms, by analyzing the behav-ioral patterns, can achieve an insight for threat hunting. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based model for Ethereum threat hunting. The model applies a deep neural network for attack detection and uses a combination of machine learning algorithms (unsupervised with supervised algorithms) for attack classification. The performance evolution of the proposed model in terms of accuracy presents 97.72 % in Ethereum attack detection and 99.4% in attack classification.\nPublished in: 2021 IEEE 20th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)\nDate of Conference: 20-22 October 2021\nDate Added to IEEE Xplore: 09 March 2022\nISBN Information:\nISSN Information:\nDOI: 10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00160\nPublisher: IEEE\nConference Location: Shenyang, China\nI. Introduction\nBlockchain is a data management technology introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin in 2008 [1]. The advent of blockchain is considered a notable stride in the modern world, quickly gained high popularity by influencing the applied and academic spheres [2], [3]. A blockchain is a distributed cryptographic ledger that provides a platform that non-trusting members can trade and interact securely and without the need for a trusted authority. The first-generation blockchain is exclusively used in digital currencies (e.g., Bitcoin), whereas the second-generation blockchain (e.g., Ethereum [4]) can execute decentralized applications (DApps) in their platform powered by smart contracts [5], [6]. Ethereum has many potential applications in the financial system [7], electronic voting [8], Internet of Things (IoT) [9], [10], distributed provenance [11], among others.\n\nSign in to Continue Reading\nAuthors\nFigures\nReferences\nCitations\nKeywords\nMetrics\nMore Like This\nRule extraction from recurrent neural networks using a symbolic machine learning algorithm\nICONIP'99.
