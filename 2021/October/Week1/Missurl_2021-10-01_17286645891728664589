        "original_content": "A\nfter two months, Tho Vu was infatuated. The 33-year-old customer service agent, living in Maryland, had met \u201cZe Zhao\u201d through a dating app, and says she quickly began exchanging messages with him all day on WhatsApp. He seemed like someone she could rely on\u2014he called her \u201clittle princess\u201d and sent her reminders to drink enough water. By October 2021, despite never having met in person, they were talking about where to buy a house, how many kids to have, even how he hoped she\u2019d do a home birth. \u201cI want to take you with me when I do anything,\u201d he said, in messages seen by TIME. \u201cYou are as important [to me] as my mother.\u201d\nTo fund their life together, Zhao pushed Vu to invest in Bitcoin. Vu was impressed by the cryptocurrency\u2019s massive price gains. She was also reassured by Zhao\u2019s suggestion that she buy her Bitcoin through Coinbase, an established U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, before transferring it to Zhao\u2019s favored site. \u201cEvery time we did the trades he would repeat why we were doing it,\u201d says Vu now. \u201cIt was always, \u2018babe, we\u2019re doing this for our future\u2019.\u201d \nOnly when Vu tried to withdraw her gains did she realise that Zhao was a fiction\u2014and so was that trading site. She\u2019d been sending those tokens straight to a team of professional crooks. It was a so-called \npig-butchering scam\n\u2014also known as a crypto-romance\u2014in which criminals spend weeks or months gaining victims\u2019 trust. Vu says she lost about $306,000, including her investment and additional payments she was told were fees and taxes by the fake exchange. \u201cThat was one of the most traumatic events in my life,\u201d says Vu. \u201cNot only had I lost all my savings, but this future that I thought would be a new adventure\u2014it was all a lie.\u201d\nTracking crypto\nCryptocurrency scams, like the one that Vu fell for, are driving an online crime boom right now. Romance scams, investment scams, digital wallet hacks, pyramid schemes, ransomware attacks, and even digital art thefts\u2014the methods may be different, but wherever you find a cybercrime victim, odds are good that crypto was involved.\nAccording to a report from the research firm \nChainalysis\n, which tracks the movement of cryptocurrency across the internet, $14 billion worth of cryptocurrencies was sent to \u201cillicit\u201d wallet addresses last year, triple the amount for 2017. Those digital wallets may have been used for fraud, terrorism, or payments for child abuse material. There are so many crypto-romance victims that they have formed an advocacy group, the Global Anti-Scam Organization (GASO), which counts Vu as a member. Last year alone, GASO\u2019s fraud reports added up to $73 million in losses. \nAnd when it comes to things like ransomware attacks, the damages add up quickly. In February, the Chicago financial firm Jump Trading sunk \n$320 million\n into bailing out its Wormhole crypto platform after a massive hack. Meanwhile, the rush of everyday investors into crypto has created a wealth of new targets.\nThe challenges of recovering money in crypto scams\nMany people assume that cryptocurrency is so popular with criminals because tokens move anonymously. In practice, major digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether are actually very trackable. Every transaction is permanently recorded on a public blockchain\u2014essentially a decentralized database. Although real names aren\u2019t attached, criminals become vulnerable when they try to cash out their crypto into dollars, euros, or another traditional fiat currency.\nThat\u2019s because swapping crypto for fiat money requires an exchange such as Coinbase or Binance. These exchanges are regulated in many countries, including the U.S., and are required to collect information about their users. A warrant or court order could compel those exchanges to reveal those wallets\u2019 owners.\n\u201cI think there is a false sense of security among crypto-criminals about the difficulty of being traced,\u201d says Ben Hamilton, a forensic investigator who tracks down financial crooks for the risk management firm Kroll. \nIndeed, the U.S. Department of Justice recently \ncharged two people\n with laundering $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin from a 2016 Bitfinex hack, having traced the coins through a complex web of transaction records. Investigators such as Chainalysis \nare monitoring the wallet addresses\n holding stolen funds from the Wormhole hack, meaning the culprits may struggle to cash out. \nRead more:\n \nInside the Chess Match That Led the Feds to $3.6 Billion in Stolen Bitcoin\nThe bigger problem is actually recovering the money. With fiat currency, international transfers often don\u2019t actually move any funds\u2014banks can simply adjust their records of who owns what, so transactions can be blocked or reversed.\nBlockchain transfers, on the other hand, are automated and almost impossible to tamper with. Tokens can be transferred across borders without any outside permission, and all transfers are totally irrevocable: if a scammer tricks a victim into sending them crypto, or gains control of someone\u2019s wallet and sends their money elsewhere, there is no central institution to reverse the transfer. \u201cMy scammer just kept pushing me to buy Bitcoin,\u201d says Vu. \u201cWith cryptocurrency he could be anywhere in the world and still get the money. With banking, it has an institution, it has a location.\u201d\nAuthorities\u2014generally restricted by regional and national borders\u2014struggle to keep up. Jan Santiago, deputy director of GASO, says police forces will often refuse to follow crimes outside their geographic area, and many barely understand what cryptocurrency is. \u201cYou have to go to the FBI level, but everyone\u2019s going to the FBI, and the FBI is overwhelmed,\u201d he says. (An FBI spokesperson declined to comment.)\nChainalysis\u2019 data suggests that crypto money laundering is highly centralized in a few lightly regulated countries, especially Russia, or in exchanges that obscure their location. \nThat points to a need for international cooperation, says Mark Turner, a managing director in Kroll\u2019s financial regulation unit. Turner argues that nations must agree on international standards for managing the flow of illicit crypto. Governments could regulate crypto wallets as they do bank accounts, allowing exchanges to blacklist specific wallets based on their compliance status, while banks could block transfers to and from questionable exchanges.\nAvoiding crypto scams\nIn the meantime, crypto users will have to protect\u2014and educate\u2014themselves. \u201cThe naivety and ignorance of many people diving head-first in the crypto world is the biggest attraction to these scammers,\u201d says one moderator of Reddit\u2019s CryptoScams message board, which has seen an \u201cexponential\u201d rise in traffic over the past year. Con artists exploit the lack of safeguards in crypto infrastructure, often coaching victims through the process of giving away the so-called seed phrases that unlock their wallets. Many popular wallet services and crypto art marketplaces also do not offer multi-factor authentication, a common way of making digital accounts more secure.\nAnother CryptoScams moderator, Luis Garcia, says a \u201cculture of instant gratification\u201d and feverish hype around new crypto projects leads to \u201cirrational decisions.\u201d He advises crypto users to never give out their seed phrases to anyone, and to never Google search the name of a legitimate service instead of typing in its URL directly (scammers sometimes buy ads at the top of search results for popular crypto sites in order to to lure you onto a dangerous fake site). \nBe careful who you trust, says Garcia, whether buying a wallet or using an exchange\u2014and never let anyone else manage your money, especially if you met the way Vu met her scammer. \u201cBeware of direct messages [DMs],\u201d he says. \u201cBeing tricked in DM can cost you everything you own.\u201d"
