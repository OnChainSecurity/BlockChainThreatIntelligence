        "original_content": "The Benefits and Vulnerabilities of Blockchain Security\nBy \nEstevao Costa\n - October 19, 2021\nUpdated: November 18, 2021\nBlockchain is a technology that\u2019s still in its infant stage.\nCommonly associated with cryptocurrencies, numerous industries are starting to move their payments and transaction needs to the blockchain.\nBlockchain is so versatile that besides recording financial transactions, it can store medical records, conclude binding agreements, track the flow of goods, store personal credit records, track the provenance of artwork, and even verify payments through a supply chain (Source: \nAppinventiv\n).\nBlockchain started as the technology behind Bitcoin and has since grown into a promising mitigation technology for cybersecurity.\nAs data breaches continue to be a problem for organizations worldwide, with each breach costing an average of $3.86 million in 2020 (Source: \nPonemon Institute\n), blockchain offers companies a way to save money and safeguard their data and operations.\nBefore we jump into how different industries are leveraging blockchain security, let\u2019s understand blockchain technology.\nWhat is Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a data structure, or distributed ledger technology (DLT), that records transactions between multiple computers, ensuring more security, transparency, and decentralization for user and company operations (Source: \nHackernoon\n). \u00a0The blocks of data are interconnected, forming a chain of records controlled by no single authority and open to any and every member of the blockchain.\nThus, the chances of fraudulent activity or duplication of transactions are eliminated without the need of a third party.\nOnce information is stored on the blockchain, it\u2019s immutable. The blockchain secures each transaction with a digital signature that proves its authenticity. Through the technology\u2019s encryption and digital signatures, the data stored is tamper-proof and cannot be changed.\nAny industry can use blockchain. This is because any digital asset or transaction can be inserted into the blockchain. The new technology is considered a reliable cybersecurity protocol due to its capabilities of indicating any foul play and providing certainty in the integrity of transactions (Source: \nCyber Management Alliance\n).\nIs Blockchain Security the Future?\nLike many innovations, blockchain started as the supporting technology for a specific disruptive product: Bitcoin. Now, blockchain\u2019s popularity has expanded across the cloud, growing into a promising mitigation technology for cybersecurity at large.\nIn today\u2019s digital age, our information is being stored and shared online. Almost all businesses and organizations rely on digital means to conduct transactions and record history. This dependence on ever-evolving cloud storage technology and online data transfers has brought lapses in security protocols that regularly expose sensitive information to malicious actors. Therefore, finding a reliable cybersecurity protocol that can handle the always-changing way society deals with big data is vital.\nIndustries across the board are latching onto new technologies that aim to improve data and network integrity, and right now, blockchain security is leading the way.\nBlockchain presents many benefits to cybersecurity, but it doesn\u2019t come without its vulnerabilities too.\nLet\u2019s look at the benefits first.\nBenefits of Blockchain Security\nThe advantages of blockchain revolve around one of its main characteristics \u2013 decentralization, ensuring a higher level of data integrity throughout multiple operations.\nDecentralization of Storage Systems\nIn recent years, there have been millions of cyber attacks on organizations. And one common element between all the organizations is that they used a centralized system. This means that a hacker can access a large amount of a company\u2019s critical data in one place (Source: \nMedium\n).\nTake, for example, the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017. The attacks impacted roughly 230,000 computers in 150 countries. WannaCry targeted vulnerable computers that had yet to update their Microsoft Windows operating system (Source: \nKaspersky\n).\nOnce inside the computers, attackers stole user information, which would be returned for a ransom. Although there\u2019s no guarantee, if not paid, hackers would permanently delete the data. It\u2019s estimated that the WannaCry ransomware attack caused $4 billion in losses across the globe.\nShifting to decentralized systems is a way to prevent ransomware, like WannaCry, from taking advantage of a single vulnerability point in a computer.\nWith a centralized system, data is typically stored, updated, and managed through one location rather than spread out across many. In contrast, with a decentralized system, data relevant to respective sites are stored and maintained independently of a central hub. (Source: \nMedium\n)\nBlockchain follows this rule with data spread across multiple computers. Since the same data is distributed and synchronized in several independent locations, the prospect of hacking the entire system makes cyber attacking complex and cumbersome.\nIoT Security\nEdge devices such as mobile phones, cameras, routers, and switches are becoming a point of interest for hackers. With technologies like \nartificial intelligence (AI)\n and 5G enabling the growth of the \nInternet of Things (IoT)\n, if a malicious threat gains access to one device, it can compromise your entire system.\nUnderstand how 5G\u2019s impact on IoT-enabled applications is leading us into the future. Read our blog, \nThe Smart Cities of Tomorrow Enabled by 5G and IoT\n.\nOrganizations can use blockchain to secure interconnected devices and systems by decentralizing their administration. Blockchain technology gives devices the capability to make security decisions on their own by analyzing the network and forming a consensus on what constitutes regular and suspicious activity in the chain (Source: \nForbes\n). In essence, each point in the blockchain is another hurdle for the hacker to deceive instead of having one central administration or authority for the cyber attack to overcome.\nIoT Applications have increased the demand for stronger security solutions. CENGN works with Canadian SMEs to test and validate innovative network security approaches to ensure modern and future networks remain protected from cyberattacks. Find out how we can help on our \nSecurity\n page.\nSecure Messaging Communication\nThe advancement of our networks has led to an evolution of how we communicate. Currently, organizations send messages through multiple digital channels allowing the transfer of various file formats. This flexibility has improved production and collaboration but has also brought its risks through increased vulnerability points.\nTo maintain secure networks, message platform developers implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in their applications. This method encrypts information so that only the players engaged in communication can read the messages, excluding Internet service providers, the app developer, the government, or anyone else (Source: \nStream\n).\nBlockchain can build on the advantages of current E2EE solutions, developing an even more secure environment for users. Blockchain can enable cross-messenger communication capabilities through a standard security protocol, allowing for a unified API framework that secures all data exchange processes (Source: \nCyber Management Alliance\n).\nFor example, \nSense Chat\n is a blockchain-enabled messaging platform that operates over existing services like Kik, WeChat, Slack, Skype, Facebook Messenger, and beyond (Source: \nDisruptor Daily\n). Features include anonymous connections, peer-to-peer video, and crypto-friendly messaging.\nBlockchain Security Vulernabilities\nBefore discussing blockchain\u2019s potential vulnerabilities, it\u2019s important to note that these vulnerabilities vary based on the blockchain type, namely public and private blockchain.\nPublic blockchain networks are open and allow any user to join, ensuring their anonymity. Public blockchain leverages internet-connected computers for validating transactions alongside achieving consensus. Ethereum is an example of a public blockchain (Source: \n101 Blockchains\n).\nOn the other hand, private blockchain networks depend on identity for confirming membership and access privileges. For example, the investment banking company, J.P. Morgan, uses a private blockchain network to simplify, streamline, and verify transactions and contracts (Source: \nEuromoney\n).\nAttacks to blockchains vary according to whether they\u2019re public or private networks, but there are four primary ways hackers threaten blockchains: phishing, routing, Sybil, and 51% attacks.\nPhishing Attacks\nEven with all the security features blockchain offers to organizations and users, they are still susceptible to phishing attacks. This scam attempts to attain a user\u2019s credentials without their knowledge through email.\nFraudsters send wallet key owners emails posing as a legitimate, authoritative source asking users for their credentials using fake hyperlinks. User\u2019s credentials and other sensitive information in possession of hackers can result in losses for the user and the blockchain network (Source: \nJscrambler\n).\nRouting Attacks\nBlockchains rely on real-time, large data transfers. Hackers can intercept data as it\u2019s transferring to internet service providers hijacking IP prefixes or dropping connections momentarily, preventing the system from reaching consensus.\nIn a routing attack, blockchain participants typically can\u2019t see the threat, so everything looks normal. However, behind the scenes, fraudsters have extracted confidential data or currencies (Source: \nACM\n).\nSybil Attacks\nIn a Sybil attack, hackers create and use many false network identities to flood the network and crash the system. The name derives from a study about a woman named Sybil Dorsett, who was treated for Multiple Personality Disorder (Source: \nBinance\n).\nCarrying out Sybil attacks, hackers can gain disproportionate influence over the honest nodes on the network if they create enough fake identities. They can then refuse to receive or transmit blocks, effectively blocking other users from a network.\nFor now, no known detection or prevention method exists for this type of attack, and if they achieve large scales, they may become what is called 51% attacks.\n51% Attacks\nCryptocurrency mining requires a vast amount of computing power, especially for large-scale public blockchains. But if a miner, or a group of miners, could rally enough resources, they could attain more than 50% of a blockchain network\u2019s mining power. Having more than 50% of the power means controlling the ledger and manipulating it to reverse transactions.\nIn 2018, three renowned cryptocurrency platforms experienced issues from 51% attacks. The three platforms were Ethereum Classic, ZenCash, and Verge. Globally, enterprises lose around $20 million annually due to 51% attacks (Source: \n101 Blockchains\n).\nToday\u2019s Use Cases in Four Seperate Industries\nCompanies across sectors are quickly adopting blockchain security. Here we\u2019ve listed examples of blockchain being used to keep critical data safe in four different industries: \nBanking, Healthcare, Defense, and the Public Sector.\nEnhanced Security for Banking with Blockchain Technology\nSecurity is a vital factor for financial institutions worldwide \u2013 it\u2019s what assures clients that their money and information is safe.\nUnfortunately, banks suffer an average of eighty-five attempted serious cyberattacks a year, and one-third of attacks are successful, compromising confidential information and costing organizations millions of dollars (Source: \nComputer Weekly\n).\nIn search of better security protocols, financial institutions are looking at blockchain for cybersecurity solutions. These organizations want to move away from the risks of centralized cybersecurity protocols and ensure their assets are safely guarded.\nThis is where blockchain comes in. It offers multi-layered security protocols to decentralize risk and provide assurance to institutions and customers in transactions. An early adopter of this type of solution is Banco Santander.\nSantander is one of the largest banks in Europe, with over USD 1.7 trillion in assets (Source: \nSantander\n), and was one of the first banks to adopt blockchain to secure their international payments service.\nMindful of the benefits of blockchain technology to the security and speed of payments, Santander created One Pay FX. Leveraging Ripple\u2019s blockchain network, Santander launched the first blockchain-based international transfer service in Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Poland, Chile, and Portugal (Source: \nSantander\n).\nAdditionally, in September 2019, to demonstrate the security of a blockchain system for banking, Banco Santander issued a $20 million bond using the Ethereum blockchain. They performed an early repayment of the blockchain-based bond three months later to show how debt security can be reliably managed through its entire lifecycle on a blockchain (Source: \nCoin Telegraph\n).\nSantander\u2019s use of the blockchain for cybersecurity is a testament to the industry\u2019s tech possibilities. As cyber-attacks continue to become more sophisticated, blockchain can be a tool to help financial institutions protect themselves while streamlining services.\nDecentralized Security for Healthcare Systems\nLike banking, the healthcare industry suffers from cyber attacks, with hacking incidents climbing year after year. In 2020, attacks rose 42% compared to 2019, partially caused by the healthcare industry\u2019s vulnerability and overload due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Source: \nForbes\n).\nThe industry safeguards critical patient and personal information, which in the wrong hands can be used to extort healthcare companies and hospitals for millions.\nBlockchain\u2019s decentralized nature may be the solution to assist the healthcare industry in maintaining patient data integrity. By spreading small bits of information across multiple locations accessible only by permissioned users, blockchain can ensure that cybercriminals cannot access identifiable aspects of an individual\u2019s health record.\nThough the industry may be in its initial stages of introducing the technology, some companies, like \nPhilips Healthcare\n, are already working on implementing blockchain security to make a real impact on health security. The company is pairing blockchain with AI to create a new healthcare ecosystem.\nIn partnership with hospitals worldwide, Philips uses AI to discover and analyze all aspects of the healthcare system, including operational, administrative, and medical data. It then pinpoints vulnerabilities in the system and implements a blockchain solution to fix and secure the data (Source: \nThe Next Web\n).\nAI is becoming a prominent tool for cybersecurity.\nLearn more about the technology in our blog, \nArtificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity: The Benefits and Challenges\n.\nBlockchain Security to Streamline and Secure the Defence Industry\nThe defence industry has pioneered multiple technologies we use today, like the Internet and GPS.\nBlockchain might be the next.\nBlockchain is seen as a legitimate data safeguard for militaries, defence contractors, and aerospace companies that house critical mission data and have complex supply chains to manage. Decentralization helps keep data secure, and blockchain\u2019s inherent capability of keeping track of information without tampering or data corruption can substantially improve defence suppliers\u2019 operation efficiency (Source: \nPWC\n).\nLockheed Martin\n, an American defence and aerospace company, is among those implementing blockchain solutions.\nThe defence contractor has secured access to SyncFab\u2019s supplier intelligence platform, built on blockchain, to help manage Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in Switzerland. (Source: \nCoin Telegraph\n)\nThe platform essentially works as a \u201cmatchmaker\u201d between OEMs and subject matter experts, allowing the experts to compete for long-term logistics opportunities with larger companies. This solves both supply chain management challenges and ensures the integrity and security of confidential manufacturing data.\nThe Public Sector\u2019s Improved Efficiency with Blockchain Security\nGovernments and public sector organizations currently use inherently insecure and costly systems, operating in a centralized fashion with siloed data.\nBlockchain can help the government move away from this security risk, offering more secure, agile, and cost-effective structures that safeguard essential data, reducing the potential for corruption, and increasing society\u2019s trust in governmental and online civic systems (Source: \nConsensys\n).\nGovernments can leverage blockchain for several security imperative applications, from payments and land registration to supply chain traceability and elections.\nThe Australian government is at the forefront of governmental blockchain implementation. The country recently prioritized the development of a cybersecurity network that runs on the distributed ledger technology.\nThe government partnered with IBM in 2018 to develop a governmental blockchain ecosystem for securely storing documents throughout the next five years. The country\u2019s federal government hopes this will serve as a model for other governments in the future (Source: \nCoin Central\n).\nThe country\u2019s network is now in the early stages of implementation, but government officials see it blossoming into a valuable asset.\u00a0\nBlockchain Security is Still Evolving\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology, but its adoption in multiple areas beyond cryptocurrency is quickly increasing.\nWith increasing pressure to improve cybersecurity being a universal force in organizations worldwide, effective new solutions are required to ensure system integrity. Blockchain\u2019s unique benefits, such as decentralization and data transparency, open a whole new array of possibilities for security solutions.\nInterested in learning more about innovative technology being leveraged for cybersecurity purposes?\nDownload our \u201cNext Generation Network Imperative\u201d Whitepaper to find out more about the future of cybersecurity and other next-generation technologies.\nThe International Data Corporation (IDC), a world-renowned global market intelligence firm, was commissioned to complete this study.\nAbout the Author\nEstev\u00e3o Costa is the Content Writer Student at CENGN (Summer 2021) and a Marketing student at the University of Ottawa.
