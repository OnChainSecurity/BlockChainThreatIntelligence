She later ran a long-short equity portfolio for a large European hedge fund. But it was when she started her own hedge fund that she encountered asset management\u2019s high barriers to entry.\n\n\n\u201cI was shocked by the inefficiencies in the industry,\u201d El Isa said. She\u2019d never dealt with the costly administrative and operational burdens of a start-up hedge fund.\n\n\n\u201cWe had floors of operational people at the big institutions where I worked previously, but I never actually knew what they did,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a small- to medium-sized entity with less than $200 million under management, you\u2019re set up to fail.\u201d After a year of swimming against the tide, trying her utmost to succeed, she realized it was not going to work and liquidated her hedge fund.\n\n\nThen while determining her next move from a beach in Brazil, she began reading about bitcoin and became hooked on Ethereum. \u201cI was so excited by everything I was reading: I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of not fully immersing myself in it,\u201d El Isa said. \n\n\nIn late 2015, she moved to \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d in Switzerland where she joined a very techy bitcoin scene. \u201cI was the only woman and only non-developer at the bitcoin meet ups,\u201d she said. At the very first meeting, someone asked her if she was there by mistake. \u201cNo,\u201d she told him. \u201cThis is exactly where I\u2019d planned to be.\u201d\n\n\nIn 2016, she co-founded Melon, now rebranded to the Enzyme protocol, within Avantgarde Finance, as a way to break down the barriers to entry in asset management. \u201cMelon was the second or third player in DeFi, before the DeFi term was even a thing,\u201d El Isa said. \u201cWe set off to build the first \u2018on-chain asset management infrastructure\u2019 on Ethereum.\u201d Her firm weathered the crypto bear markets of 2018 and 2019 and the pandemic and is still going strong. Since launching Version 2 in January 2021, Enzyme has acquired $40 million in assets under management (AUM), a 700% jump. \n\n\nDeFi vs. Trad Fi\n\n\n\u201cDeFi has huge promise for greater efficiency, accessibility, and transparency that will result in new ways of working and reaching more people than traditional finance.\u201d \u2014 Eelco Fiole, CFA\n\n\nButerin defined a \u201csmart contract\u201d as a computer program run on a blockchain that controls digital assets. DeFi is a category or application that seeks to replicate financial services and different types of financial contracts \u2014 whether you\u2019re holding or trading assets or creating contracts between assets.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come really far in DeFi in the last three years,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cUp until recently there were barely any interesting applications.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had real traction for the first time ever,\u201d El Isa added. \u201cIn the last bull market, we had crazy valuations and DeFi applications that hadn\u2019t ever delivered. It\u2019s more exciting this time around. We have technology that works and we\u2019re growing fast in terms of user adoption.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIn order for DeFi to really scale,\u201d she went on, \u201cwe need to focus our efforts now on security and insurance. With DeFi, you are the responsible person: There\u2019s no one to look after you if things go wrong.\u201d \n\n\nEl Isa hopes insurance applications like Nexus Mutual that provide safety and security for users will scale and succeed and pave the way for mass DeFi adoption. \n\n\nIn addition, well-known trade-offs among accessibility, usability, and scalability are on the decline. For Ethereum, Buterin expects the severity of such trade-offs to continue to decrease as scalability technology improves. \u201cCurrently the capacity of Ethereum blockchain is fairly limited and transaction fees are fairly high,\u201d he said. His researchers are working to scale the Ethereum blockchain itself in layer 2.0. Other near-term improvements in usability and lower technology costs will help make it more acceptable to people who\u2019ve never participated in blockchain before.\n\n\nFiole mentioned, as of today ETH has a market cap of $400 billion and Ethereum as a core technology has some of the greatest development activity and the most available applications.\n\n\nGovernance and Regulation\n\n\nFiole extolled the blockchain as a groundbreaking technology, singling out its \u201ctrustless\u201d quality \u2014 that is, the trust is built-in through code. By comparison, traditional asset management is highly regulated, with even more regulations on the horizon, around climate-change, for example.\n\n\n\u201cIn DeFi, you have to assure both integrity of the protocol and investor protection,\u201d Fiole said. For example, protocols use \u201cadministrator keys\u201d to manage risks, make upgrades, and even enforce emergency shut downs. Users have to have trust in the ecosystem and are dependent on the administrators.\n\n\nButerin said governance means different things for different DeFi applications. The Uniswap decentralized exchange, for example, needs very little governance \u2014 it\u2019s only a contract you interact with. Governance becomes more of an issue for the more complicated applications.\n\n\nAs a case in point, El Isa said that Enzyme is one of the more complex protocols. \u201cWe upgrade in a decentralized way,\u201d she said. Users have to opt-in to upgrades. In keeping with decentralized values, they are not forced to upgrade.\n\n\nEnzyme has three types of stakeholders: Tokenholders, Developers (vault or investment managers), and Users (investors in the vault) \u2014 each with their own set of incentives related to governance of the protocol. Tokenholders are rewarded with higher token value if the protocol is used. Developers receive (MLN) tokens if they do good work. \n\n\nEl Isa and her team recognized early that users, on the other hand, did not have good representation, even though they trusted the system the most. \u201cSo we established a governance council consisting of both technical experts, including auditors for smart contracts, and users,\u201d she explained.\n\n\nAlpha Generation and Risk Management\n\n\nEl Isa noted the appeal of yield-bearing strategies, given the shortage of digital dollars. \u201cYou can find very attractive lending rates on digital dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd any positive yield looks attractive, especially if you\u2019re in countries like Switzerland where you have to pay to keep your money in a bank account.\u201d \n\n\nThese yield strategies also hold up well in different market environments or during periods of high volatility.\n\n\nRecently yield farming has become popular where rewards in the native tokens are received over and above normal yield for providing liquidity to the protocol and thereby offering a kicker in the rate of return. Though, as always, investors need to pay attention to potential risks.\n\n\nIn yield farming, yields are variable and the highest yields often come from the riskier protocols. \u201cYou need to look at the quality of the code base and risk profile of the codes,\u201d El Isa said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a lender in DeFi and the protocol gets compromised or exploited, you could have a total loss of funds in a worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\n\nButerin believes the yield farming opportunities will decline as protocols scale. He also emphasized the technical risk. Every smart contract has some chance of breaking. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what that chance is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut investors need to understand this risk.\u201d\n\n\nFiole noted that today DeFi has $76 billion in total locked-in value and over 7,000 coins and counting listed on exchanges. He asked, \u201cHow many tokens are we going to see?\u201d\n\n\nEl Isa doesn\u2019t believe there should be a limit on the number of tokens. \u201cJust when it becomes overwhelming, this is where asset management helps to filter,\u201d she said. She sees a parallel in the evolution of asset management in traditional financial markets \u2014 investors first focused on passive token strategies and now there\u2019s a real shift to active management to create alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Future Outlook of Blockchain and DeFI\n\n\nOver the next few years, Buterin expects the technical challenges of blockchain technology \u2014 such as the breaking of cryptography by super computers \u2014 to be solved one by one: Scalability and security will be improved through Ethereum 2.0, leading to more applications. Ethereum researchers are also working on an exciting \u201cproof of stake\u201d algorithm to reduce Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by a factor of more than 1,000 (99.9%).\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the very early days of DeFi,\u201d El Isa said. \u201cBut this time is much more exciting. We\u2019re seeing real usage and traction. This time around it\u2019s more oriented around features and usability. It\u2019s no longer just about the token price.\u201d\n\n\nIf you liked this post, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to the \nEnterprising Investor\n.\n\n\n\n\nAll posts are the opinion of the author.
