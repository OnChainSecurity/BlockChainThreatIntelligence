It is gaining more significant momentum exponentially and disrupts the way businesses function beyond the digital currency aspects. This work presents a text mining literature analysis of research articles published in major digital libraries on blockchain technology and cybersecurity. This literature analysis employs automated text mining approaches such as topic modeling and keyphrase extraction for unearthing the themes from a vast body of literature. This analysis highlights the multidisciplinary nature of blockchain technology within the cybersecurity domain. The findings also show the cyber threats and vulnerabilities that evolve with blockchain technology developments. This analysis also showcases the computer security research community\u2019s vulnerabilities and provides future research dimensions that are crucial for designing secure blockchain applications and platforms.\n\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\nKeywords\nBlockchain technologyCybersecurityVulnerability assessmentText miningTopic modelingLiterature analysis\n1. Introduction\nBlockchain was initially introduced with the concept of cryptocurrencies \nTandon, Revankar, Palivela, & Parihar (2021)\n, especially Bitcoin \nNakamoto (2009)\n. However, this back-end transaction recording technology has great potential in taking out the notion of trust from the central third parties to the cryptographically verifiable platform. The idea of decentralization of doing businesses has grown leaps and bounds and has already found its scope in supply chains \nAhsan & Siddique (2022)\n; \nDeepu & Ravi (2021)\n, health-care \nHussien, Yasin, Udzir, Zaidan, & Zaidan (2019)\n; \nYaqoob, Salah, Jayaraman, & Al-Hammadi (2021)\n, marketing \nJain, Dash, Kumar, & Luthra (2021)\n & finance \nGrover, Kar, Janssen, & Ilavarasan (2019b)\n,food \nYadav, Misra, & Goundar (2020)\n & agriculture marketing \nYadav, Misra, & Goundar (0000)\n, banking, insurance, sports \nYadav, Misra, Rana, & Singh (2021a)\n; \nYadav, Misra, Rana, Singh, & Goundar (2021b)\n, cyber-security \nAzmoodeh, Dehghantanha, Conti, & Choo (2018)\n; \nKar & Navin (2021)\n; \nMittal, Gupta, Chaturvedi, Chansarkar, & Gupta (2021)\n, and many more \nGrover, Kar, & Janssen (2019a)\n; \nUpadhyay (2020)\n. The well defined and established cryptographical \nLuntovskyy & Guetter (2018)\n and mathematical techniques like hashing \nAlkandari, Al-Shaikhli, & Alahmad (2013)\n make the ever-growing ledger of blockchain tamper-proof, secure and immutable \nYaga, Mell, Roby, & Scarfone (2018)\n. However, they have certain limitations \nAli Syed et al. (2019)\n; \nLee, Yang, Onik, & Kim (2019)\n. Blockchain also uses consensus algorithms for verifying and joining the blocks to it. For instance, the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm \nGemeliarana & Sari (2018)\n; \nGupta & Mahajan (2020)\n, the major public blockchain networks such as bitcoin and Ethereum uses was prone to vulnerabilities \nKaushal, Bagga, & Sobti (2017)\n such as 51% attack \nApostolaki, Zohar, & Vanbever (2017)\n. Such threats and flaws boosted the scope of the research in the security domain of blockchain technology. Later evolved Blockchain 2.0, which focuses on the idea of smart contracts was initially coined by Nike Szabo \nSzabo (1997)\n. Smart contracts \nFerreira (2021)\n or law of code \nFilippi & Hassan (2018)\n, has the potential to eliminate the requirements of any trusted third party. Ethereum \nButerin (2013)\n and the Hyperledger Fabric, with the chain code \nDinh et al. (2018)\n, came to be a few of the widely accepted blockchains with smart contracts. Unlike the bitcoin blockchain where the total number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, Ethereum has no such limit. However, Ethereum also uses the PoW consensus algorithm. After analyzing a significant number of blockchain literature, it is evident that smart contracts can have prominent use in the fields beyond finance \nFerreira da Silva & Moro (2021)\n; \nStallone, Wetzels, & Klaas (2021)\n, yet there is a wide scope of improvement with respect to the cyber security \nGehem, Usanov, Frinking, & Rademaker (2015)\n; \nKim, Jeong, Kim, & So (2011)\n; \nLi & Liu (2021)\n.\n\nThe systematic literature analysis on the body of knowledge related to blockchain technology using topic modeling highlights the trends and gaps and suggests prominent future trends are invaluable. Topic models are a suite of text understanding algorithms that unearth the latent patterns from large bodies of unstructured text documents. This method is widely used in several applications \nJadil, Rana, & Dwivedi (2022)\n; \nJutla, Bodorik, & Zhang (2006)\n; \nWandabwa, Naeem, Mirza, & Pears (2021)\n. The natural language processing \nNair, Agrawal, Domnic, & Kumar (2021)\n; \nR, Kuanr, & KR (2021)\n based approach has itself spread over several fields like journalism \nMa, Nadamoto, & Tanaka (2006)\n etc. and for different application including business \nVerma, Sharma, Deb, & Maitra (2021)\n, IoT \nHerath & Mittal (2022)\n. There are several topic modeling algorithms available \nGallinucci, Golfarelli, & Rizzi (2015)\n; \nKinoshita, Takasu, & Adachi (2015)\n, those differ in the way they make assumptions to generate hidden word collections called \"topics\". A paper by Vayansky et. al. \nVayansky & Kumar (2020)\n presents a more detailed review of the topic modeling. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI), etc., were the topic modeling algorithms introduced early in the natural language processing literature. A mixed model of top-down and bottom-up approaches was presented by Catarina et al. \nFerreira da Silva & Moro (2021)\n to analyze the application of blockchain technology for consumer trust. Jiang et al. \nJiang, Xie, & Fan (2021)\n analyzed 282 articles in their study to present the research trends focused on the business & management in blockchain networks. In another related study on the review of blockchain cyber security \nTaylor, Dargahi, Dehghantanha, Parizi, & Choo (2020)\n, the blockchain-based security applications are analyzed, showing the increase in the adoption of blockchain networks in various domains. Taylor et al. have also discussed the security of blockchain in IoT and AI data security in their article \nTaylor et al. (2020)\n. Blockchain technologies have been considered an effective solution for shared data protection and providing data trust as a service as suggested by Richard et. al. \nLomotey, Kumi, & Deters (2022)\n.\n\nBy adopting text mining, it is possible to cover a vast body of knowledge that otherwise would render infeasible only at the expense of computational power \nFeng, Chiam, & Lo (2017)\n; \nMoro, Cortez, & Rita (2015)\n; \nSkute (2019)\n. In contrast, we focus on studies that highlight the cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and their mitigation in blockchain technology. We adopt an existing top-down and a bottom-up procedure based on the blockchain taxonomies to draw the list of keywords from each of the gathered 833 articles, published until April 2022. This approach enriches existing blockchain taxonomies by benefiting from a passive crowd-sourcing effect. The authors defined the articles\u2019 keywords and considered them essential for indexing purposes. The articles are then automatically analyzed using text mining and topic modeling to unveil interesting topics that summarize the existing body of knowledge. The use of text mining to conduct literature analyses is becoming mainstream as science keeps developing grounded on Internet media \nFeng et al. (2017)\n; \nSkute (2019)\n. Through such an approach, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of BC from the critical consumer trust perspective. We raise the research questions (RQ) as given in \nTable 1\n.\n\nTable 1. Research Questions raised for the study .\n\nResearch QuestionDescription\nRQ1Are there any correlations between the cybersecurity researches and blockchain vulnerabilities? If so, how both these are correlated?\nRQ2What are the major types of cyber-attacks that blockchain networks are highly prone to?\nRQ3How the blockchain technology has span over different application areas and what could be its security consequences?\nRQ4How the previous security vulnerabilities and research could be useful for research communities in protecting the existing and upcoming blockchain networks?\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows: We discuss the inception and evolution of blockchain technology, the prominence of blockchain in cybersecurity, and discuss topic modeling with reference to one of the most widely used algorithms called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in \nSection 2\n. \nSection 3\n presents the materials and methods adopted in this analysis, and \nSection 4\n presents the results and the deliberations. The applications and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed in \nSection 5\n, and the future research trends are outlined in \nSection 6\n. In \nSection 7\n, the authors conclude the findings, and some perspectives are also presented.\n\n2. Cybersecurity and the prominence of blockchain technology\nImproving security measures, building a safe environment over the internet, and ensuring the quick availability of information at the same time seems to be an ever-lasting challenge. Unfortunately, even after this many technical advancements, many of the previous research works show that the overall blockchain network is still prone to cyber-attacks \nChen et al. (2022)\n; \nChristen, Schnell, Ranbaduge, & Vidanage (2022)\n; \nWang, Wang, Cao, Li, & Xiong (2019)\n. Vulnerable consensus mechanisms are one of the reasons for some security threats, which ultimately can affect the entire blockchain network. As per the data collected from the CVEs \ncve (1999)\n database, we found that some of the most common vulnerabilities on blockchain networks are (a) 51% or Majority Attack (in PoW-based blockchains like Bitcoin), (b) Routine attack (double coin spent), (c) BC Endpoint Vulnerabilities, (d) Attacks due to vulnerability in smart-contracts and their deployment, (e) Transaction Privacy Leakage, and, (f) Phishing Attacks. As per the official portal of CVEs \ncve (1999)\n, the DoS (denial of service) was the very first cyber attack launched on the Bitcoin blockchain in 2010.\n\nTill now, over sixty easy and hard level vulnerabilities have been reported just for bitcoin and related blockchain networks in the last few years. Due to having a reward mechanism in PoW, the vulnerable proof-of-work consensus algorithm is responsible for most of these attacks. However, along with the high threat of 51% attack, bitcoin was also found to be vulnerable to some other cyber-attacks, including denial-of-service \nBaek et al. (2019)\n and bypassing the authentication \nSingh, Hosen, & Yoon (2021)\n, in many cases. Ethereum overcame many of these security issues, but it was found to be vulnerable. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) \nZhao, Chen, Chen, Wang, & Tang (2017)\n, the largest crowdfunded project on Ethereum blockchain, was one of the well-known applications of blockchain during 2016. However, later, the attack on DAO further led the Ethereum blockchain to split into two branches forming the Ethereum & Ethereum Classic. Several smart contracts were also vulnerable, and such incidents have kept on occurring. It brought in new ideas leading to a rapid improvement in the security side of blockchain. Many improvements were suggested in the traditional PoW consensus algorithm by developing new alternative consensus mechanisms \nMasseport, Darties, Giroudeau, & Lartigau (2020)\n; \nXue et al. (2018)\n. One such method is Proof-of-Stack (PoS) \nNair & Dorai (2021)\n that does not require mining and hence reduces the environmental loss as in PoW. We went through some previous research works that came up with strengthening these blockchains and focusing on the security aspects of the same \nKushwaha, Joshi, Singh, Kaur, & Lee (2022)\n; \nNam & Kil (2022)\n; \nSayeed, Marco-Gisbert, & Caira (2020)\n.\n\nTo ensure the proper security of the existing and the upcoming blockchains, early detection and mitigation of possible cyber attacks is a good idea. Due to being closely related to the previous attack vectors, some specific sub-part of the blockchains could be highly vulnerable to the different attacks. So, we considered some interesting articles related to the topic modeling for blockchain and its applications. One such work related to the topic modeling by Catarina et al. \nFerreira da Silva & Moro (2021)\n presents an intelligent approach for not only understanding the work but also opens the doors for even more research areas based on the similar areas of the applications \nGeorge & Birla (2018)\n. The topic modeling \nBarde & Bainwad (2017)\n; \nCheng, Yan, Lan, & Guo (2014)\n is found to have a good impact in figuring out the most common and probable problems. We suggest the most important research topics to enhance blockchain security that would highly be in demand in the coming future by the detailed study and the statistical analysis of the evolution of research works based on cyber security in the blockchain domain. We have also provided a range of meaningful insights about the application areas beyond the cryptocurrency domain of blockchain, including IoV, supply-chains, IoT, and health care industries.\n\n3. Methodology\nOur complete study revolves around major four research questions provided in \nTable 1\n. This work uses a semi-automatic literature and vulnerability analysis approach, which is very similar to the method adopted by Catarina et al. \nFerreira da Silva & Moro (2021)\n. We have analyzed a total of 833 research articles from the Web of Science (WoS) and over 65 vulnerabilities and the complete flow of the process is shown in \n1\n. We have incorporated the inclusion and exclusion criteria as mentioned in \nHiebl (2021)\n. \nTable 2\n shows a few of the recent works, from all 833 articles, done in the domain of cyber security for many application-based blockchains. The data was gathered from different sources, including the official CVEs vulnerability database \ncve (1999)\n. The research papers and vulnerabilities were primarily focused on blockchain technologies and crypto-wallets. We found that our data is sufficient to understand and analyze the increase in blockchain-based security threats and the evolution of BC technology over the last more than ten years. We initially prepared a list of keywords of the desired terms. Later we used the same to filter and collect only those research papers that consisted of these keyword(s) among 1222 articles. These filters include \"attack+AND+blockchain\", \"cybersecurity+AND+blockchain\", \"hacking+AND+blockchain\", and \"security+breach+AND+blockchain\". Out of all these articles collected, the duplicate and irrelevant articles were removed (n=389), and the remaining 833 articles were used for the analysis. We used web scraping to collect the data from CVEs database \ncve (1999)\n related to the domains like blockchain and Ethereum or bitcoin or cryptocurrency wallets. Once we collected the data for ten years, we pre-processed the same. We collected the year of publishing, author information, title, focused area, and some more necessary keywords from the abstracts of every article. Much non-relevant and the same information were removed to create a clean dataset of research papers. We also figured out the information, including CVE ID, year of disclosure, CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score, type of vulnerability, and strength of its impact for each vulnerability gathered from the CVEs database \ncve (1999)\n. This procedure was followed by a detailed textual-statistical analysis of both articles and the vulnerabilities.\n\nFig. 1\nDownload: Download high-res image (249KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 1. Workflow of the proposed approach for the text mining literature analysis.\n\nTable 2. Some of the already available literature reviews on \"Blockchain for Cybersecurity\" .\n\nAuthorsStudyFindings\nB Alotaibi (2019)Blockchain cybersecurity in IoTBlockchain technology will be a potential enabler to overcome IoT limitations that are related to cyber security.\nPJ Taylor et al. (2020)Blockchain for cybersecurity (General)Blockchain applied to improve cybersecurity in IoT, data storage and sharing, network security, private user data, navigation and utility of World Wide Web.\nS Demirkan (2020)Blockchain cybersecurity in business and accountingBlockchain impacts auditing in different ways that will change the profession drastically.\nM Liu (2021)Blockchain for cybersecurity (General)Blockchain technology can solve many issues related to cybersecurity.\nV Wylde (2022)Blockchain for cybersecurity and privacyIdentified a system necessary in carrying out experiments to detect, capture, process and store data.\nAfter the primary cleaning of the dataset, as the data was ready for initial analysis, we analyzed the growth statistics for blockchain security-based research over the years. We analyzed it using the tokens extracted from the extended text information like the abstract. It included over 50 sub-domains directly related to blockchain technology, mainly distributed/parallel/cluster computing \nFirouzi, Farahani, & Marin\u0161ek (2022)\n, security, and cryptography. Later we extract even more frequently discussed areas out of the whole. As blockchain applications increased \nHall\u00e9, Khoury, Betti, El-Hokayem, & Falcone (2018)\n; \nL\u00f3pez-Pintado, Dumas, Garc\u00eda-Ba\u00f1uelos, & Weber (2022)\n, our study also gave us insights into the growth and evolution of generations of blockchain along with its security measures. The study was carried out for the data related to the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs \ncve (1999)\n) by initial quantitative analysis of the disclosed vulnerabilities every year since 2010. The analysis also tells about the seriousness and impact of the disclosed vulnerabilities and their CVSS score. It tells about some of the most common vulnerabilities in the BC networks. This heavily insightful statistical analysis of the textual dataset directed us for the topic modeling based on the previous research works.\n\nInitially, we used the BERTopic technique for topic modeling that creates some clusters of terms based on their frequency of occurrence. Later these clusters were used to generate new topics that could be interpreted easily. For this purpose, we used the abstracts of all 833 articles to get 16 different topics. However, this method also included non-relevant terms like \"pool\" and \"meter\". We extracted the key phrases from all abstracts using rapid automatic keyword extraction (RAKE) to improve the results. The RAKE uses a list of stopwords and phrase delimiters. Hence it efficiently removes unnecessary words & phrases and detects the right keywords. It helped us generate N-gram-based topics, yet these topics were not wholly interpreted. After this, we extracted a set of tokens from each abstract that were highly relevant using the spaCy module of python. It proved to be very helpful for the final topic modeling step. After removing the less frequently occurring token, we finally built a corpus of several tokens. This corpus was used as a parameter during the generation of new topics. After checking for the coherence score for the different topics, we finally generated 13 topics using the LDA algorithm, giving the maximum coherence score.\n\nBased on the topic building, we created a dashboard to understand the relevance and the coherence of different topics \nChuang, Manning, & Heer (2012)\n; \nSievert & Shirley (2014)\n. It displayed the top 30 terms related to each corresponding topic. We also analyzed and compared several critical terms related to new topics we generated by tuning the relevance matrix. We also compared the outcomes of analysis and topic modeling carried out on the research works with the insight related to blockchain vulnerabilities. All the experiments are performed in Python language. We used the natural language toolkit (NLTK) available at \nhttps://www.nltk.org/\n during the data cleaning, exploration, and processing phases. The matplotlib and seaborn \nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html\n modules, available at \nhttps://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html\n and respectively, were also utilized to visualize the exciting outcomes of our study. We also compared key-phrase extraction and topic generation methods, including RAKE available at \nhttps://csurfer.github.io/rake-nltk/_build/html/index.html\n and BERTopic available at \nhttps://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html\n and Gensim available at \nhttps://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/index.html\n. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate the topics from the collected articles.\n\n4. Findings\nAccording to an analysis done on 475 recently published articles (\nFig. 2\n), IEEE was the top-most publisher among the top-ten publishers. We have analyzed 833 papers during the period 2013-2022. We have figured out the acceptance and authenticity of these research works and represented the same through citation networks generated using the data collected from WoS. We used VOS Viewer for generating these networks, which can be accessed at \nhttps://app.vosviewer.com/\n.\n\nFig. 2\nDownload: Download high-res image (96KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 2.

On the other hand, \nFig. 4\n shows a similar network for different authors working in this domain. The study also highlights that what all countries are focusing on blockchain development and the citation network based on the country is provided as \nFig. 5\n. The figure shows that the number of publications and citations are from countries such as the USA, India, Australia, and the UK. \nFig. 9\n shows that in the blockchain research domain, the majority are centered around the research on privacy, cyber security, attacks, smart contracts, and the security of the internet of things.\n\nFig. 3\nDownload: Download high-res image (194KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 3.

It includes the data of 66 unique vulnerabilities collected from the CVEs database \ncve (1999)\n discovered in the last 11 years(since 2010). The analysis says that almost 19.70% of all vulnerabilities were found to have medium or high access complexity. Apart from this, over 50% of all blockchain-based vulnerabilities were found to have a 5.0 or higher CVSS score. The broad level distribution of the CVSS score among the discovered vulnerabilities in BC networks can be noticed as per \nFig. 6\n.\n\nFig. 6\nDownload: Download high-res image (105KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 6. CVSS score assigned to different vulnerabilities found in blockchain.\n\nWe have answered the four main research questions (RQ) presented in \nTable 1\n, through this analysis.\n\n4.1. RQ1: Are there any correlations between cybersecurity research and blockchain vulnerabilities? if so, how both these are correlated?\nOur complete analysis indicates a strong correlation between the blockchain vulnerabilities and previous research works focused on cyber security. We have identified total 833 blockchain research among 13 topics (\nFig. 7\n). We have categorized all research articles into nine application domains and nine aspects of blockchain technologies. \nFig. 7\n also shows that the academic research in the blockchain primarily focuses on privacy in effective topology-based blockchain solutions. These also involve the security-oriented aspects, including cryptography, access type, and control for different types of blockchains. The attempts are also being made toward bringing integrity and scalability to secured blockchain networks. Please refer to the authors\u2019 profile (in the introduction) for the contact details.\n\nFig. 7\nDownload: Download high-res image (632KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 7. Discovered Topics.\n\nThe blockchain is used in advanced areas such as federal learning, a machine learning technique of training, testing, and building the ML models over a decentralized network. It has brought more concerns about several security aspects, including data security \nKhan, Ibrahim, & Hussain (2021)\n; \nTamburri (2020)\n and strong cryptography. The discovery of new vulnerabilities has boosted security research in the past few years. Considering the blockchain vulnerability dataset, we see that the attacks increased during the newly introduced blockchains over the years (\nFig. 8\n b). At the same time, \nFig. 8\n clearly shows that as soon as the cause for the same is figured out, the upcoming BC research has improved the security measures.\n\nFig. 8\nDownload: Download high-res image (386KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 8.

Number of articles highly belonging to the different topics.\n\nFig. 9\n shows the number of articles belonging to each topics. The figure depicts the maximum number of articles related to topics 1, 2, 3, and 5. It can easily be traced from \nFig. 7\n that all topics focus on the network topology, privacy, and security in highly demanding sectors like finance, healthcare, and academia. On the other hand, papers assigned with topics 4, 6, 7, 9, and 11 are closely concerned about the cyber security-oriented aspects of blockchains like cryptography, vulnerability, attack & mitigation. These all indicate why the rapidly carried out research works seem to be very much influenced by the attacks, hence focusing on the security in the BC domain.\n\nA network plot in \nFig. 10\n represents the co-relation between the different key-phrase extracted from the abstract section of each paper related to \"blockchain for cybersecurity\". This plot gives insight into the various terms discussed in these BC research works. The exciting part is that we can find many terms varying too much from each other.\n\nFig. 10\nDownload: Download high-res image (2MB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 10. The network that shows top keywords from the published articles on the theme \"blockchain for cybersecurity\".\n\nThis all acknowledges that there exists a significant improvement in blockchain research in terms of cyber security.\n\n4.2. RQ2: What are the major types of cyberattacks that blockchain networks are highly prone to?\nThe threats related to cyber attacks are increasing with time with the growth of the technologies. We have analyzed over 60 different vulnerabilities reported in the last 11 years. The information related to these different blockchain vulnerabilities was gathered from the CVEs database \ncve (1999)\n by considering seven key factors as described in \nTable 3\n. We also referred to the GitHub repository of CVEs for scraping and collecting the information from open source. We have used beautifulSoup Library available at \nhttps://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/\n for scraping. These all vulnerabilities are closely related to several aspects of blockchain networks. It can be inferred from \nFig. 11\n that there are more than 30 vulnerabilities responsible for adversely impacting the availability of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, i.e., CIA tried of cyber security in corresponding BC technology wholly or partially. Supporting the same, it can also be seen that the Denial of Service (DoS) is the most common attack that can be launched using more than 20 vulnerabilities out of the total 66 analyzed ones. Blockchain is also highly prone to cross-site scripting (XSS) and similar injection attacks following the DoS.\n\nTable 3. Seven key factors considered during gathering the blockchain vulnerabilities .\n\nResearch QuestionDescription\nCVSS ScoreIt is ranged between 0 to 10 in order to quantify the severity of the vulnerability. +\nConfidentiality ImpactDefines how confidentiality of the system is affected in case of the exploitation.

Cumulative count of different blockchain vulnerabilities reported since 2010.\n\nAn exciting thing noticed about remote code execution (RCE) is that it has repeatedly appeared after every four years since 2011. However, the threats of the overflow attacks were found to increase rapidly between 2016 to 2018 but now seem to be tackled well. These attacks are found to compromise every component of the CIA triad based on the scenario. The code execution vulnerability could be combined with a few other vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting and may also lead to the DoS attacks. Over the past few years, the repeated occurrence of code execution highlights that the different blockchains are prone to attack through such vulnerabilities, especially in their early phase. The relaxing thing is that mitigating code execution vulnerability is not a considerable overhead in the case of blockchains.\n\nBased on the discovered 13 topics, the LDA plots give a high-level overview of the relevance of the articles. This relevance is computed based on the several terms extracted from the articles during topic modeling. We can find that all of the considered and analyzed research works have more or less focused on the security aspects of BC technologies to a large extent. For instance, \nFig. 12\n and \nFig. 13\n represent the LDA visualization on topic #6 for the term \n and \n, respectively. In \nFig. 12\n, the top 30 most relevant terms for topic #6 are shown along with the inter-topic distance map. From the analysis of the topic words, it is clear that the topic is on smart contract vulnerability as the contributing words are contract, smart, vulnerability, etc. Topic #11 and topic #13 are also found to be overlapping with topic #6 and show that these topics are also discussing vulnerabilities in code (smart contracts). The summarized answer to this question will be that blockchain is vulnerable to several severe attacks that may affect the integrity of information and disrupt the quality of decentralization, a core requirement for the BC networks. BC developers and researchers must consider the cyber attacks seriously not only because such attacks have been increasing over the past several years but also because more than 50% of the vulnerabilities are assigned with a 5.0 (medium) or higher CVSS score (\nFig. 6\n). Over 20% of vulnerabilities range from 7.0 to 10.0, i.e., High to Critical levels.\n\nFig. 12\nDownload: Download high-res image (487KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 12.

RQ3: How the blockchain technology spanned over different application areas and what could be its security consequences?\nStarting with bitcoin, as an application for cryptocurrencies for secure money transactions, blockchain technology has now spread over a wide area of applications within just a few years. The generation of DApp (decentralized applications) has also opened the doors for several blockchain use cases. As noticed in \nFig. 7\n, the domains like artificial intelligence & machine learning (AI/ML) \nFirouzi et al. (2022)\n; \nSalles et al. (2017)\n, healthcare industries, IoT, e-governance \nKassen (2022)\n; \nLiu, Lu, Yu, Paik, & Zhu (2022)\n and transportation \nBatta, Gandhi, Kar, Loganayagam, & Ilavarasan (2020)\n are some of the trending areas of BC application. Interestingly these are very different from the sector of cryptocurrency and finance. The blockchain has also been suggested to implement better cyber security interfaces by its complex cryptographic functions and decentralized infrastructure \nN\u00f3brega, Pires, Nascimento, 2021\n, \nN\u00f3brega, Pires, Nascimento, 2022\n.\n\nFig. 14\n shows the network of several application areas of the blockchain technologies. Here terms like Controle, Cyberinfrastructure, IoT security, cyber-physical security \nAlwan et al. (2022)\n and secure smart city represent some of the blockchain applications that are part of cyber security domains. These different application domains also have specific security threats depending on their popularity, userbase, and novelty. Based on this plot, we can currently group these application areas into 8 clusters.\n\nFig. 14\nDownload: Download high-res image (385KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 14. Major application areas of Blockchain where cybersecurity studies are conducted.\n\nDifferent countries are working toward building a better, more secure, and more application-based solution on the BC networks. \nFig. 15\n represents the countries publishing research papers in blockchains in recent years. It can be seen in \nFig. 15\n that the USA is the top-most country, followed by China and India.\n\nFig. 15\nDownload: Download high-res image (96KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 15. Top 10 countries/regions publishing the most number of articles on \"blockchain for cybersecurity\" theme.\n\nWe have also studied the ten years from 2013 to 2022 in-depth. The outcomes of the trend in BC research works, relevant vulnerabilities, and application domains are visualized in 10 different word clouds and collectively represented as \nFig. 16\n. Each of these world clouds provides information about the research done in one particular year and elaborates on the key terms that were primarily discussed. For instance, \n in blockchain seems to be initially coined in 2015. On the other hand, 2016, when the \n was taken seriously in BC technology, got the most crucial place in upcoming years. One interesting fact about this sudden change in trend is the DAO attack launched in 2016, which led the Ethereum network to split into two parts by hard forking.\n\nFig. 16\nDownload: Download high-res image (2MB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 16. Topic word cloud generated for the publications reported from the year 2013 to 2022, on the theme \"blockchain for cybersecurity\".\n\n4.4. RQ4: How the previous security vulnerabilities and research could be useful for research communities in protecting the existing and upcoming blockchain networks?\nThe top-10 area of research (\nFig. 17\n) in the last few years show that the maximum number of research articles are published in the Computer Science domain. This study shows that many research works mainly in the BC domain also focused on other areas like business economics and finance. We found from our statistical analysis of research articles that several new blockchain applications have come into sight over the years (\nFig. 14\n). The word clouds in \nFig. 16\n clearly show an increase in new aspects of blockchain technologies, including smart contracts, federal learning (FL) \nChand & Zhang (2022)\n; \nLomotey et al. (2022)\n; \nWeigand, Blums, & de Kruijff (2020)\n and scalability. The demand for a more secure blockchain infrastructure has been noticed since the attacks started to appear on BC networks (\nFig. 16\n b). Proposed research insights show significant growth in the trend of security-oriented research works from 2016.\n\nFig. 17\nDownload: Download high-res image (158KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 17. Top 10 research areas where the most number of research articles are published.\n\nNow, when it is clear that attacks that happened in the early days of the development of blockchain technology led to the newer and more secure BC networks, we can analyze as many vulnerabilities as possible in blockchain and figure out the root cause. Based on the outcomes, more detailed research could be done to test and mitigate all possible threats in any upcoming blockchain before it could be launched. The increase in these trends can be closely related to the consistent rise in BC technologies. The attack like double-spent and the possibility of 51% led to the development and acceptance of Ethereum over the Bitcoin blockchain. Smart contracts were introduced for the more secure BC network. Similarly, the DAO attack on Ethereum brought the attention of the developers towards the hard fork as a solution. Comparing the statistical analysis done for BC vulnerabilities and a variety of research articles \nFig. 8\n and \n18\n, it is clear that the research has evolved immediately after a high rise in cyber attacks in the year 2013 and 2018 (\nFig. 11\n) in order to protect the BC from similar attacks in upcoming years.\n\nFig. 18\nDownload: Download high-res image (70KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 18. Different types of publications reported on the theme \"blockchain for cybersecurity\".\n\n5. Application and limitations of proposed approach\nThis complete analysis considers the different phases of the blockchains since the early evolution in 2013 to study their cyber security aspects. We have also analyzed over 60 vulnerabilities in different blockchain networks and applications. The work concludes that we have successfully figured out the trade-off between cyber attacks on BC technologies due to new vulnerabilities and growth in the cybersecurity-related research works done in blockchain over the last decade. It involves the multi-dimensional analysis of 833 research articles (\nFig. 9\n) published by many reputed publishers (\nFig. 2\n) and centered around many applications \nHussien et al. (2019)\n; \nYaqoob et al. (2021)\n, improvements, and architectural proposals \nAli Syed et al. (2019)\n; \nXu, Nikouei, Chen, Blasch, & Aved (2019)\n in the fields of BC technology, which is closely related to the cyber security. It also included several articles proposing implementing cyber security solutions using BC technologies \nGoel, Agarwal, Vatsa, Singh, & Ratha (2019)\n. The comprehensive study gives meaningful insights into which phase of development the blockchain networks and applications are highly prone to cyber-attacks and those possible attack types.\n\nThe outcome of our study gives insights to plan for detecting and mitigating specific vulnerabilities for secure development practices in blockchains. However, our study is carried out on an uneven number of research works done for different domains of application for cyber security in blockchains. Although the insights tell that it might be needed to specify a different approach for different blockchain networks or solutions based on their application domain, architecture, and complexity \nStallone et al. (2021)\n, the proposed works do not cover the mitigation side of possible vulnerabilities of different blockchain technologies. As we do not target any specific BC type or application area, a similar approach can be used to study only relevant vulnerabilities to understand the possible application-specific cyber threats like blockchain in IoT \nSingh et al. (2021)\n. On the other hand, the results received after an application-centered analysis can lead to an even better and fine-tuned solution that will surely enhance the approaches suggested by our study.\n\n6. Recommendation for future research\nAs per our analysis, the results indicate that presently the BC research done in cyber security domains is inspired by previous attacks. However, several methods have been introduced for the prevention of cyber-attacks \nPawar & Palivela (2022)\n; so far, the main objective has been to quickly mitigate the exposed vulnerabilities to stop or reduce the impact of the cyber attack. Therefore, these research works have been centered around analyzing the reasons for the different attacks and mitigating to recover the affected BC network. In addition, we suggest that we have data related to the vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks in several application domains of blockchain. We can estimate the relationship between the types of attacks on the new blockchain networks on the respective domains.\n\nOur analysis shows that in the CVEs discovered in the past few years, there has been a consistent increment in the number of vulnerabilities. In order to reduce such vulnerabilities in the upcoming blockchains, it is necessary to research estimating possible types of vulnerabilities and get ready with their solutions before the occurrence of new attacks. FL could be used more effectively for this purpose as well. Work should also be done to find the best approach for risk assessment in the BC technologies. Along with the research on developing technical solutions for possible threat detection and risk assessment in upcoming blockchains, work should also focus on the best approaches for application security and assessment in the relevant BC technologies. We suggest the three major areas where researchers should have higher requirements on cyber security in blockchain, mentioned here in this section.\n\u2022\nExploring the existing reasons in depth which are responsible for the re-appearance of certain vulnerabilities repeatedly over the fixed number of years even after proper mitigation: Indeed, the blockchain has evolved in several aspects over the past few years. However, during the same period, blockchain technology has also noticed an overall increase in cyber attacks. Research and development have mitigated these issues to some extent, as well. Nevertheless, it is also noticed that vulnerabilities belonging to specific categories have remained after some fixed interval. Remote code execution is one such vulnerability rated between 5.0 to 8.0 in terms of CVSS. Although their influence has been waived off shortly, such vulnerabilities manage to repair. In such a situation, the researcher can not only focus on identifying these (or other possible cyber threats) vulnerabilities in the early stage of blockchain or before launching the same, but also they can develop the solutions before any cyber attacks by improving the possible vulnerable sections of different components like smart contracts \nAmponsah, Adekoya, & Weyori (2022)\n.\n\n\u2022\nPrioritizing the security and risk assessment aspects in blockchains: There are plenty of cyber attacks possible on blockchain networks. In such a situation, one of the main challenges is sorting the steps of risk assessment to better address the cyber threats in the blockchain. It is seen through the study that the possibilities of occurrence of the vulnerabilities vary based on the blockchain application domain. Due to these reasons, it becomes necessary to study and analyze the risk assessment approaches and define the best practices that could be acceptable for the maximum variety of the BC networks. The prioritization of testing for the different vulnerabilities based on valid and logical reasons should also be kept as the objective of the work.\n\n\u2022\nScope of using machine learning approaches for estimating highly possible types of attacks for dedicated blockchains: Since the beginning of 2009, when the blockchain came into existence, a noticeable growth has been recorded in the subsequent cyber security domain. The blockchain has developed in more secure electronic cash transactions or cryptocurrencies and evolved in plenty of application domains. Several machine learning-based approaches have been introduced to detect attacks like DDoS \nThorat, Parekh, & Mangrulkar (2021)\n. Federated Learning is one such growing area of application in blockchain technologies. More and more industries, businesses, and corporates are adopting blockchains. When technical and architectural improvements are being introduced in BC technologies through scalability and integration, the complexity of the network has increased. It also increases the scope of cyber attacks even further. In order to detect and mitigate the possible attacks in such situations also need more advanced steps. Hence, the possibilities of machine learning approaches should be analyzed for dynamic risk assessment and threat hunting at an early stage of blockchain-based solutions. The hybrid BC architectures are also in trend, aiming to effectively coordinate on-chain and off-chain processing for the transactions. Novel BC solutions might also be scalable; ML can be used to decide and perform the off-chain processing.\n\n\n7. Conclusions\nFollowing the research questions we presented in the Introduction section of this article, we have created a set of keywords related to the cybersecurity aspects of blockchain and used these to query Web of Science and obtained a total of 833 articles. We followed both top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan and structure our analysis. We have implemented the top-down procedure based on BC taxonomies from the existing research literature. The bottom-up procedure was implemented using the collected article\u2019s list of keywords. The articles were collected from the year 2013 to 2022. We have done a manual analysis linking the collected article\u2019s keywords and blockchain taxonomies and then used a text-mining algorithm (LDA) to unearth topics that enable the analysis of large bodies of unstructured text existing with the already published literature. This analysis helped us establish the relationship between the cyber security aspects of blockchain technology to the vulnerabilities and other bugs. We also discuss some limitations of our approach and plan to extend the work to other popular databases and open repositories not covered in WoS. Based on our analysis, some future research dimensions regarding cybersecurity aspects of blockchain are also discussed."
