The thieves stole 173,600 in Ethereum cryptocurrency, equivalent to $594.6 million, along with $25.5 million in U.S. dollars for a total of $620 million in stolen funds.\n\n\nAre you ready for AI agents?\nChainalysis, which offers crypto compliance and investigation software, said \non Twitter\n that the theft amounts to the \u201clargest-ever DeFi exploit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe can confirm Chainalysis is tracking the funds on their behalf,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis is an active investigation and we will provide updates when possible.\u201d\n\n\nVentureBeat has reached out to Chainalysis for any further available details on the investigation.\n\n\nCryptocurrency intelligence firm Blockchain Intelligence Group said in an email that among the stolen funds, 4,970 ETH ($16.9 million) \u201chas already moved to exchanges,\u201d as of Noon PST Tuesday.\n\n\nSecurity breach\n\n\nSky Mavis said the theft \noccurred\n in connection with a security breach of the Ronin Network, in which the attacker utilized \u201chacked private keys\u201d to facilitate withdrawals of ETH and U.S. funds.\n\n\n\u201cWe are working with law enforcement officials, forensic cryptographers, and our investors to make sure there is no loss of user funds,\u201d Sky Mavis said. \n\n\nFrom the Sky Mavis \nstatement\n:\n\n\nEarlier today, we discovered that on March 23rd, Sky Mavis\u2019s Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were compromised resulting in 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC drained from the Ronin bridge in two transactions. The attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals. We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge.\n\n\nThe attack was made possible in part by access permissions that should have been revoked, but weren\u2019t. In November, the Axie DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) \u201callowlisted Sky Mavis to sign various transactions on its behalf,\u201d Sky Mavis said in the statement. \u201cThis was discontinued in December 2021, but the allowlist access was not revoked.\u201d\n\n\nIn a \ntweet\n, Veracode cofounder and CTO Chris Wysopal said that \u201ca case of not revoking permission which kept open authorized attack surface can be very expensive in the crypto world.\u201d\n\n\nBlockchain-based security implications\n\n\nIf Sky Mavis can\u2019t recover the funds, that\u2019s a huge hit to its overall treasury and a black eye for blockchain-based security, GamesBeat \nreported\n today. The reason for putting the Axie Infinity game on the blockchain is to enable better security, GamesBeat noted.\n\n\nSky Mavis uses the blockchain to verify the uniqueness of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), which can uniquely authenticate digital items such as the Axie creatures used in Axie Infinity. \n\n\nNFTs exploded in popularity last year and helped enable\u00a0\nSky Mavis to raise $152 million\n\u00a0at a $3 billion valuation in October.\n\n\nOn its crypto heist tracking page, Comparitech also said that the Ronin Network theft now \nranks\n as the largest such theft to date, surpassing the $610 million theft from the Poly Network in August 2021.\n\n\nChainalysis said that crypto theft had already been surging. The firm \ntweeted\n that $3.2 billion in cryptocurrency was stolen overall in 2021, which is six times the amount that was stolen the year before. \n\n\nOf the amount stolen in 2021, $2.3 billion was stolen from DeFi platforms, Chainalysis said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVB Daily\n\n\nStay in the know!
