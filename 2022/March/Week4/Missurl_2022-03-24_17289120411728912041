        "original_content": "\n\nThe fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) system\u2014the collection of finance applications built on blockchain technology\u2014holds promise for a new financial architecture that can eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries (such as banks, brokers, and exchanges) and reduce rents (excess profits) in the financial sector. But it also generates formidable challenges for regulators, according to a paper discussed at the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA) conference on March 24, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDeFi applications might have the potential to democratize finance by creating a level playing field among providers of financial products and services,\u201d write the authors\u2014Igor Makarov of the London School of Economics and Antoinette Schoar of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\nBut, they warn in \nCryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n, the reduction of rents might not materialize automatically. Rents are often the result of inherent constraints to competition that arise from network externalities (the phenomenon that the value of a financial service or DeFi app increases as its use becomes more common) and economies of scale. These constraints exist both in the traditional financial system and the new architecture, and thus require careful regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permissionless and pseudonymous design of DeFi applications can severely limit the ability of regulators to oversee the industry and restrict unscrupulous actors. DeFi generates challenges for enforcing tax and money laundering laws and preventing financial malfeasance, and as a result can create negative spillovers on the rest of the economy.\n\n\nThe paper explains how decentralized finance works and the mechanics behind it, such as the security protocols of different cryptocurrency blockchains and smart contracts (embedded computer code that automatically executes transactions when predetermined conditions are met). The authors lay out potential benefits and challenges of the new system, including the difficulty of providing effective consumer financial protections.\n\n\nThe authors then highlight ways to regulate the DeFi system which would \u201cpreserve a majority of features of the blockchain architecture but support accountability and regulatory compliance.\u201d They propose regulatory oversight of validators\u2014the blockchain network participants who ensure the integrity of the blockchain ledger (the decentralized record of transactions) and who are paid in cryptocurrency for verifying transactions. Regulators could certify validators to ensure they check that addresses on cryptocurrency networks belong to certified entities and then only process transactions to and from certified addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf regulators wait too long, in effect cryptocurrencies and DeFi applications can become too-big-to-regulate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHow the technology and regulation of the DeFi system evolve has important consequences for the global economy and ultimately to the United States\u2019 standing in it, the authors write. They note that the United States enjoys \u201csignificant economic and strategic benefits\u201d from the central role of the dollar and U.S. financial system and conclude, \u201ctherefore it is in the U.S. interest to encourage innovation and modern financial technologies but at the same time set standards that protect consumers and maintain the transparency and accountability of the system.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, the exponential growth of cryptocurrencies and the growing political clout of the crypto community means time is short for finding regulatory solutions, the authors caution. \u201cIf regulators wait too long,\u201d they write, \u201cin effect cryptocurrencies and DeFi applications can become too-big-to-regulate.\u201d\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAknowledgment\n\n\nDavid Skidmore authored the summary language for this paper.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nMakarov, Igor and Antoinette Schoar. 2022. \u201cCryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\u201d\u00a0\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity,\u00a0\nSpring. 141-196.\n\n\nGorton, Gary. 2022. \u201cComment on \u2018Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\u2019.\u201d \nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity,\u00a0\nSpring. 197-205.\n\n\nPrasad, Eswar. 2022. \u201cComment on \u2018Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\u2019.\u201d \nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity,\u00a0\nSpring. 206-212.\n\n\nDisclosure\n\n\nGary Gorton is the Frederick Frank Class of 1954 Professor of Finance at the Yale School of Management.
