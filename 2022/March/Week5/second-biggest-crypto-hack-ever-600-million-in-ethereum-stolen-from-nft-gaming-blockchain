According to Ronin, most of the hacked funds are still in the hacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nKey Background\nTuesday\u2019s hack on Ronin marks one of the biggest hacks in cryptocurrency history and is even bigger than the $460 million hack on cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox that led to the company\u2019s bankruptcy and heightened regulation in the nascent space about seven years ago. Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler has repeatedly said cryptocurrencies deserve more government scrutiny, particularly to help protect investors. Last year, he called on Congress to ramp up its authority over the cryptocurrency industry. \"Right now, we just don\u2019t have enough investor protection in crypto,\" he said. \"Frankly, at this time, it\u2019s more like the Wild West.\"Crucial Quote\n\"As of right now users are unable to withdraw or deposit funds to Ronin Network,\" the company said Tuesday. \"Sky Mavis is committed to ensuring that all of the drained funds are recovered or reimbursed.\"\n\nBig Number\n$14 billion. That\u2019s how much money illicit cryptocurrency addresses received last year, climbing 79% from one year prior and marking an all-time high for cryptocurrency-based crime, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which cited the explosion in mainstream cryptocurrency adoption as a main catalyst.\n\nFurther Reading\nFeds Seize $3.6 Billion In Stolen Bitcoin, Arrest Couple Five Years After Massive Crypto Exchange Hack (Forbes)"
