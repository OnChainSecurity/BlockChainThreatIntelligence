It primarily deals with transactions involving financial assets. On the other hand, it is important to know that \ncommon smart contract vulnerabilities\n could lead to big losses.\u00a0\nAs a matter of fact, smart contract vulnerabilities have been responsible for financial losses measuring over $12.3 billion. For example, the DODO \nDEX\n lost almost $3.8 million in March 2022 to a smart contract vulnerability. In April 2023, one of the popular \nDeFi platforms\n, \nYearn Finance\n, lost $10 million due to smart contract flaws.\u00a0\n\n\nSmart contracts are responsible for transactions involving massive volumes of important data and assets, such as money transfers, service delivery, and access to protected content. As a result, they can be easy targets for hackers and other malicious actors. On the other hand, awareness of \nsmart contract vulnerabilities\n could offer the opportunity to prepare for smart contract attacks. Let us learn more about some of the most common vulnerabilities of smart contracts and how you can resolve them.\u00a0\n\n\nExcited to learn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development, Enroll now in the\u00a0\nSmart Contracts Security Course\n\n\nPopular Vulnerabilities for Smart Contracts and Mitigation Strategies\n\n\nSecurity is one of the foremost priorities in the process of designing and developing smart contracts. The different \ntypes of smart contract attacks\n in recent times and their magnitude imply that \nsmart contract security\n is a mandatory requirement for new \nblockchain\n and \nweb3\n solutions. On top of that, you could not make any changes in the smart contracts once they have been deployed to blockchain networks with different vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n\n\nMost important of all, the vulnerabilities of smart contracts are visible to everyone after they have been deployed on blockchain networks. Therefore, development teams and smart contract engineers must pay attention to the most important attack vectors for smart contracts. Here is an outline of the most common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the strategies for mitigating them.\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the prominent entries among vulnerabilities for smart contracts is Oracle manipulation. Smart contracts rely on oracles for accessing external data from sources outside the blockchain network. However, oracles can be responsible for \nsmart contract security issues\n as malicious actors could manipulate oracles to achieve personal interests.\n\n\nOracles help smart contracts interact with off-chain systems. On the other hand, manipulated or inaccurate Oracle data could enable automatic execution of smart contracts. Such types of issues are classified as Oracle issues for smart contracts. The Oracle issue has been responsible for exploitation of different \nDeFi applications\n.\u00a0\n\n\nThe most common example of such \nproblems with smart contracts\n is visible in the flash loan attacks. Flash loans allow users to borrow any amount of \ncryptocurrency\n without any limit as long as they repay the loan in the same transaction. Attackers can use such loans to distort asset prices and generate profits without compromising the \nprinciples of blockchain technology\n.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can find solutions to the Oracle issue for smart contracts with decentralized oracles, such as Tellor or \nChainlink\n. Another recommended mitigation strategy for such risks points to the use of multiple oracles. Decentralized oracles or multiple oracles for one smart contract ensure accuracy of input data for the oracle. Such types of oracles increase the difficulty and cost of manipulating oracle data.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe most noticeable example of web2 attacks that have transitioned into the domain of web3 is denial of service. Smart contracts are also vulnerable to denial of service attacks. It is one of the common entries in a \nsmart contract vulnerabilities list,\n which can create setbacks for users and reputation of \nweb3 projects\n. The attack involves overloading a smart contract with services, such as authentication tasks.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result, the attacker could prevent other contracts from execution and lead to unexpected reverts. For example, denial of service attacks can return unused gas and revert the state of the smart contract to the state prior to execution of the transaction. Subsequently, the attacker could find that the results of an auction or values in financial transactions can be manipulated easily.\n\n\nThe promising approach to solving such \ntypes of smart contract attacks\n focuses on making the attacks costly. What are the proven ways to improve the cost of denial of service attacks for hackers? Higher gas fees and time-lock puzzles are some of the effective measures for increasing the costs of attackers. In addition, mitigation strategies for denial of service attacks also focus on making calls only to trusted contracts.\u00a0\n\n\nThe collection of different types of vulnerabilities for smart contracts also includes timestamp dependence. It is important to note that the node executing the smart contract generates timestamp values. How does the timestamp lead to \nsmart contract vulnerabilities,\n and what is their impact? The distributed nature of \nEthereum\n creates difficulties in synchronization of time on every node. Since Ethereum is the preferred platform for \ndeveloping and deploying smart contracts\n, it exacerbates the timestamp dependence issue.\u00a0\n\n\nMalicious nodes could manipulate the timestamp value for designing a logic attack. The logic attack would target contracts that utilize the block timestamp variable for execution of time-critical operations. You can resolve such vulnerabilities by avoiding the use of block timestamp function for control or logic checks. It is also important to refrain from using block timestamp function as a source of randomness.\n\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the\u00a0\nSmart Contracts Development Course\n\n\nAnother common vulnerability in smart contracts is a \nreentrancy attack\n. The attack vector emerges from the imperative execution of \nSolidity\n smart contracts. Imperative execution implies that smart contracts must execute each line of code before the next line. It implies that the execution of the calling contract can be put on hold till the return of the call when the contract makes external calls to a different contract. Reentrancy attacks are one of the common additions to a \nsmart contract vulnerabilities list\n,\n as the external contract could gain temporary control over the next sequence of events. As a result, reentrancy attacks lead to the creation of an infinite loop.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAssume that a malicious contract attempts a recursive call to the original contract to withdraw resources without completion of the first call. As a result, the original contract would never have the opportunity to update the balance before completing the function. The \nsmart contract security issues\n with reentrancy could take the form of multiple types of attacks. Some of the common types of reentrancy attacks include single-function, read-only, cross-function, and cross-contract reentrancy attacks.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can resolve problems with reentrancy attacks through careful design of external calls. It is important to note that such vulnerabilities arise from flaws in the code logic of smart contracts. Therefore, it is important to check and ensure updates on the state of the contract.\n\n\nIn addition, you can also find another proven safeguard against reentrancy attacks with a reentrancy guard. Reentrancy guards could prevent the execution of multiple functions at one instance by locking the contract. You can rely on \nsmart contract audit tools\n such as Mythril and \nSlither\n for checking the presence of different variants of reentrancy attacks.\n\n\nWant to know about the possible use cases of smart contract audits? Check out\u00a0\nSmart Contract Audit Presentation\n\u00a0now!\n\n\nSmart contracts are transparent, which implies that they are publicly visible on the blockchain network. Miners of a block could choose transactions with the highest gas fees. The priority fee is an effective tool for ensuring that you can have your transaction approved before other transactions.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, it also leads to \nproblems with smart contracts\n as attackers could front-run the profitable contracts through submission of an identical contract, albeit with a higher gas fee. Generally, attackers implement frontrunning attacks through bots or even miners.\u00a0\n\n\nYou have to look for effective solutions to mitigate the risks of \nfrontrunning attacks\n. One of the proven solutions for mitigating the risks of frontrunning involves accepting transactions that have the gas price below a specific threshold. You can also find a solution with a commit-and-reveal scheme in which users submit a solution hash first rather than a clear text solution. Malicious actors cannot view the solution before it is too late. At the same time, smart contract auditing tools can help in detecting frontrunning vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteger Overflows and Underflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic operations also play a role in creating vulnerabilities for smart contracts. \nInteger overflows and underflows\n are the most \ncommon smart contract vulnerabilities\n resulting from arithmetic operations surpassing the fixed range for the values. For the integer type uint8, the range of values spans from 0 to 255.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the values are higher than 255, then they would overflow, and the value would be reset to 0. On the other hand, values that are lower than 0 would be reset to 255. As a result, the state variables of the contract and the logic could go through unexpected modifications and could trigger invalid operations.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Solidity compiler, starting from version 0.8.0, would not allow code that could lead to integer overflows and underflows. It is also important to check the contracts that could be compiled with the earlier versions to support functions that involve a library or use arithmetic operations.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation and Function Exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology enables better accessibility for every individual. Sensitive and confidential information must be encrypted before they are saved to a blockchain network. However, transparency leads to different \ntypes of smart contract attacks\n due to visibility of functions and variables in smart contracts. As a result, the functions and variables would be open to abuse and misuse. You can find a solution to such issues with improvements in development workflow.\u00a0\n\n\nDevelopers must ensure the implementation of proper access controls. In addition, developers must also implement the principle of least privilege with the help of variable and function visibility modifiers in Solidity. The modifiers help in assigning minimum visibility levels according to the desired requirements.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next prominent cause for \nsmart contract security issues\n points to the problems with force-feeding attacks. Developers could not prevent smart contracts from receiving the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, Ether. Malicious actors could utilize this vulnerability for force-feeding smart contracts with Ether.\u00a0\n\n\nThe attack revolves around the premise of manipulating the balance of \nEther\n in the smart contract. The change in balance of Ether could lead to manipulation of function logic that depends only on desired balance for internal accounting. Some of the internal accounting processes include paying out rewards when the balance exceeds a specific level.\u00a0\n\n\nThe problem with such \nsmart contract vulnerabilities\n is that it is difficult to stop the manipulation of smart contract balance. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the balance of the contract does not serve as a guard or check within a function. The actual balance of the Ether could be higher than the balance expected by the internal code of the contract.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother prominent addition to the \nsmart contract vulnerabilities list\n is gas griefing. Users should pay a gas fee for performing a transaction or executing \nsmart contract\n on \nEthereum\n \nblockchain\n. It serves as an incentive for the validators or miners to verify transactions. On the other hand, the price of gas depends on network capacity, supply, and demand at the time of transaction.\u00a0\n\n\nGas griefing happens when users send the gas fees required for executing the desired smart contract. However, they don\u2019t send the fees required for executing subcalls or the calls made by the contract to other contracts. It would lead to a significant influence on the logic of the smart contract.\u00a0\n\n\nThe problem is that there is no proven technique for preventing gas griefing. Developers could find a solution by coding a contract for defining the amount of gas rather than the user. Such types of solutions are more likely to increase the chances of transaction failure.\u00a0\n\n\nStart learning Smart Contracts and its development tools with world\u2019s first \nSmart Contracts\u00a0Skill Path\n with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\nThe review of the different \nsmart contract vulnerabilities\n and mitigation strategies shows that awareness could solve a lot of problems. You should understand the importance of smart contracts in managing valuable data and resources. Flaws in smart contracts could lead to security issues that impose the burden of financial losses.\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore, \nsmart contract developers\n must prepare an effective risk management strategy and \nsmart contract audit\n plan for identifying vulnerabilities.
