        "original_content": " \nThis is part of \u201c\nThe Latecomer\u2019s Guide to Crypto\n,\u201d a mega-F.A.Q. about cryptocurrency and its offshoots. Kevin Roose, a Times technology columnist, is answering some of the most frequently asked questions he gets about \nNFTs\n, \nDAOs\n, \nweb3\n and other crypto concepts. \n \nWhat is DeFi?\n \nDeFi (pronounced dee-fye) is short for decentralized finance. It\u2019s an umbrella term for the part of the crypto universe that is geared toward building a new, internet-native financial system, using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries and trust mechanisms.\n \nI am falling asleep.\n \nDon\u2019t! I promise it\u2019s interesting.\n \nOK, I\u2019ll give it a chance. What do you mean by \u201cusing blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries and trust mechanisms?\u201d\n \nLet\u2019s back up a bit. To send or receive money in the traditional financial system you need intermediaries, like banks or stock exchanges. And in order to feel comfortable doing the transaction, all parties need to trust that those intermediaries will act fairly and honestly.\n \nIn DeFi, those middlemen are replaced by software. Instead of transacting through banks and stock exchanges, people trade directly with one another, with blockchain-based \u201csmart contracts\u201d doing the work of making markets, settling trades and ensuring that the entire process is fair and trustworthy.\n \nSo DeFi is crypto\u2019s version of a stock exchange?\n \nThat\u2019s part of it. But DeFi also includes things like lending platforms, prediction markets, options and derivatives.\n \nBasically, crypto people are building their own version of Wall Street \u2014 one that is largely decentralized and deals exclusively in crypto, with crypto versions of many of the products offered by traditional financial firms, and without much of the red tape and regulations that govern the existing financial system.\n \nWild West Wall Street! OK, now I\u2019m interested. How big is DeFi?\n \nDeFi\u2019s total value locked or T.V.L. \u2014 a standard way of measuring the value of crypto held in DeFi projects \u2014 is currently about $77 billion, according to \nDeFi Pulse\n. That would make DeFi something like the 38th largest bank in the United States by deposits, if it were a bank.\n \nSo not huge, but not small either.\n \nRight. And T.V.L. isn\u2019t the only way to measure DeFi\u2019s growth. You could also look at trading activity on decentralized exchanges, which has \ngrown by triple-digit percentages\n in the past year.\n \nOr you could take a cue from regulators and politicians, who are increasingly looking to DeFi\u2019s growth with concern. Michael Hsu, the acting U.S. comptroller of the currency, said in \na speech at a blockchain conference\n in September that many DeFi products reminded him of the credit default swaps and other complex derivatives that were popular on Wall Street in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n \nAnd Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, singled out DeFi in a December crypto hearing, calling it \u201cthe most dangerous part of the crypto world.\u201d\n \nWhy are people so worried about DeFi?\n \nIn short, because DeFi is mostly unregulated, with few of the consumer protections and safeguards that exist in the traditional financial system.\n \nCan you give me an example of something that would be regulated in the traditional financial system, but isn\u2019t regulated in DeFi?\n \nThe best example is probably stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of a government-backed currency, like the U.S. dollar.\n \nStablecoins are a critical part of DeFi markets, because if you\u2019re a crypto investor, you don\u2019t want to constantly be changing tokens back and forth to dollars, or keeping all your assets in cryptocurrencies whose values might fluctuate wildly. You want a crypto coin that behaves like a boring, stable dollar, which you can use without needing to interact at all with the TradFi system.\n \nTradFi?\n \nIt\u2019s what DeFi people jokingly call traditional finance.\n \nClever. So, back to stablecoins. What\u2019s dangerous about them?\n \nWell, regulators have argued that despite the name, stablecoins aren\u2019t actually that stable.\n \nAs my colleague, Jeanna Smialek, explained in \nan article on stablecoins\n last year, the worry stems from the fact that stablecoin issuers aren\u2019t legally required to back their coins one-to-one with safe, cash-like assets. Investors who buy stablecoins might reasonably assume that each USD Coin or Tether (the two most popular stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar) is worth $1, and that they will be able to redeem their stablecoins for actual dollars whenever they want.\n \nBut there\u2019s nothing in the law, at present, that requires stablecoin issuers to have one-to-one backing. And if they don\u2019t have enough reserves to cover the stablecoins they\u2019re issuing, the whole thing could collapse if enough investors decide to pull their money out all at once.\n \nThat sounds bad!\n \nIt would be, especially since stablecoins are the backbone of DeFi trading. And there are questions among investors and regulators about whether some of the \nleading stablecoin issuers\n actually have enough assets to pay out their holders, in the event of a large-scale redemption.\n \nSo stablecoins might not be stable. What else is potentially worrisome about DeFi?\n \nThe crypto firms that issue loans, credit cards and savings accounts, without many of the protections or safeguards offered by conventional banks, are also drawing concern. Regulators in the United States have begun \nclamping down on firms\n that issue these products, saying they could represent a risk to consumers.\n \nRegulators are also \nlooking into decentralized exchanges\n, or DEXs, which allow users to swap crypto tokens with the help of market-making algorithms.\n \nAnd then there are all the hacks and scams \u2026\n \nOh, great.\n \nYeah. DeFi, like crypto in general, is a big target for fraud. More than $10 billion was lost to hacks and scams in DeFi projects in 2021 alone, according to a \nreport\n from the blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.\n \nThere typically isn\u2019t much recourse for victims of DeFi scams. And unlike deposits in a regular bank, which are insured by the F.D.I.C., crypto tokens usually can\u2019t be replaced or recovered once they\u2019re gone.\n \nSo, let me get this straight. One of the fastest-growing areas of crypto is a Wild West version of Wall Street where there are no investor protections, where the things that are called \u201cstablecoins\u201d might not be stable, and where your money could be irreversibly stolen at any \ntime?\n \nThat\u2019s an unflatteringly phrased but largely accurate summary!\n \nWhy would anyone sign up for this?\n \nFour reasons.\n \nFirst, many people like DeFi \nbecause\n it\u2019s so new and unregulated. Building an entirely new financial system from scratch is the kind of intellectual challenge that doesn\u2019t come around every day, and lots of people are attracted to the sector\u2019s wide open, blank slate potential. Plus, if you\u2019re a clever trader or an experienced financial engineer, you could do all kinds of things in DeFi that you couldn\u2019t do in the traditional financial system, and potentially make a lot of money very quickly.\n \nSecond, many DeFi fans argue that blockchains are technologically superior to the existing banking system, much of which runs on ancient databases and outdated code. (Most bank transactions, for example, still rely on programs \nwritten in COBOL\n, a programming language that dates back to the 1960s.) Crypto, they say, is the first form of money that is actually devised for the internet, and as it grows, it will need a new, internet-native financial system to support it.\n \nThird, if you\u2019ve bought into the crypto/web3 vision of a decentralized economy, DeFi is the financial architecture that makes all of the things you\u2019re excited about possible. There\u2019s no way, in the traditional financial system, for a DAO to create a membership token out of thin air and use it to raise millions of dollars. You can\u2019t call up JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs and ask them to give you a quote for \nSmooth Love Potion\n, priced in Dogecoin. (Well, you could, but they might have you committed.) But with DeFi platforms, you can find people who are willing to trade almost any crypto asset for almost any other crypto asset, with no central entity\u2019s approval needed.\n \nAnd fourth, there\u2019s a more idealistic cohort of DeFi fans who see all of this heading in a much more utopian direction.\n \nDecentralizing finance, these people say, could help fix what\u2019s wrong with our current financial system, in part by eroding the power of big Wall Street banks over our economy and markets.\n \nHow would that work?\n \nThese optimists contend that because DeFi replaces human intermediaries and trust mechanisms with public blockchains and open-source software, it\u2019s cheaper (fewer fees), more efficient (faster transaction times) and more transparent (less opportunity for corruption) than the traditional financial system.\n \nThey say it democratizes investing, placing tools in people\u2019s hands that only professional investors had access to before. And because you can participate in crypto anonymously and without a bank\u2019s approval, they say, DeFi is a way to provide financial services to people who aren\u2019t well-served by the conventional banking sector, and avoid many of the discriminatory practices that have kept minorities from accessing financial services in the past.\n \nUltimately, the optimists say, DeFi will become safer and more robust over time, as more people use it and some of the early problems are ironed out. And just as they believe that web3 will replace greedy tech platforms with user-owned collectives, they believe that DeFi will replace today\u2019s banks and brokerages with a better, fairer system.\n \nThat sounds great, but I\u2019m still worried. Didn\u2019t we learn our lesson in 2008 about the dangers of unregulated finance? Could DeFi bring about the next financial crisis?\n \nRight now, it\u2019s unlikely that DeFi could produce any disasters on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. It\u2019s still a relatively small piece of the crypto world (which is a relatively small piece of the overall economy), and many of the people pouring money into DeFi are the kind of deep-pocketed investors who could absorb even big losses.\n \nBut the possibility that DeFi could grow big enough to present a systemic risk isn\u2019t lost on regulators, who are scrambling to make the Wild West of crypto a little less wild.\n \nGo deeper:\n \n\u201cFinance 3.0: DeFi, Dapps, and the Promise of Decentralized Disruption\u201d\n Kevin Werbach, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, makes the case that DeFi will revolutionize the world of finance by \u201celiminating costly and controlling intermediaries from financial transactions.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnyone Seen Tether\u2019s Billions?\u201d\n Bloomberg\u2019s report on the mysterious dollar reserves of Tether, the stablecoin at the heart of the DeFi economy, helps explain why regulators are worried.\n \n\u201cThe Defiant\u201d\n This independent media company\u2019s daily DeFi newsletter is an industry must-read.\n "
