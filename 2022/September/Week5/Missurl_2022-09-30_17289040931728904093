In addition, the EEA announced that EY Global Blockchain Leader, Paul Brody, will serve as the company\u2019s EEA Board of Directors representative, taking part in guiding the organization\u2019s vision, driving member engagement, and building new advocacy, careers, and education initiatives to advance the Ethereum business ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nJoin Paul Brody and EEA leadership at Devcon (October 11-14, 2022) in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to explore how Ethereum can be used to drive value, speed up settlement times, increase transparency and decentralize commerce across all industry sectors:\n\n\n\n\n\nEY and Brody join the \nBoard, which includes representatives from EEA member companies\n including Accenture, Banco Santander, BlockApps, ConsenSys, the Ethereum Foundation, J.P. Morgan, Microsoft, the Open Foundation, and Palm NFT Studio. As a consulting company that partners with global businesses on blockchain solutions that support the complete business lifecycle from contracting, ordering, fulfilling, and invoicing to payments, EY\u2019s expertise will be instrumental to the EEA Board and member community.\n\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting time for businesses that are building on Ethereum, with The Merge offering companies a path forward to deploying decentralized solutions on Ethereum\u2019s now energy-efficient Mainnet. With EY\u2019s combined expertise as a business leader in the Ethereum ecosystem and as a longtime EEA member, the EEA and its members can expect to benefit greatly from EY joining at the Board level. Paul\u2019s expertise in understanding business readiness and deploying enterprise-grade distributed ledger financial services solutions will be pivotal to the EEA\u2019s efforts in helping businesses deploy on the Ethereum Mainnet, and understand Ethereum technology and its business derivatives,\u201d said EEA Executive Director Dan Burnett.\n\n\nFrom acquiring insights to managing the tax and audit requirements for Ethereum blockchain-based transactions, EY helps businesses handle the regulatory and tax complexities of an emerging ecosystem. Newly appointed EEA Board representative Paul Brody was the first to lead EY\u2019s blockchain strategy engagement, working to determine how digital services and payments come together in the new digital world. Under his blockchain leadership, EY became the first Big 4 firm to commit to the public blockchain. EY\u2019s global blockchain solutions platforms, including EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer, allow businesses to harness the power of blockchain, increasing efficiency and reducing transaction costs. Both are delivered through EY\u2019s SaaS platform \nblockchain.ey.com\n and aim to address the ecosystem\u2019s most pressing problems \u2013 privacy, securpo67ity and regulatory compliance.\n\n\n\u201cEY is focused on the Ethereum ecosystem for many reasons; most importantly, it has strong organizations backing it such as the EEA and the Ethereum Foundation. It is with great excitement that I join the Board of Directors of the EEA, and I am looking forward to collaborating on what\u2019s next on the Ethereum business roadmap. The EEA is helping to do the important work of ensuring that businesses understand Ethereum\u2019s business readiness, and here at EY, we are passionate about that aspect of Ethereum. We are excited to work with the EEA to further how businesses of all sizes tap into Ethereum\u2019s potential,\u201d said Brody, who is a featured interviewee in the \nEEA Ethereum Business Readiness Report 2022\n.\n\n\n\nAbout EY\n\nEY exists to build a better working world, helping to create long-term value for clients, people, and society and build trust in the capital markets.\n\n\nEnabled by data and technology, diverse EY teams in over 150 countries provide trust through assurance and help clients grow, transform and operate.\n\n\nWorking across assurance, consulting, law, strategy, tax, and transactions, EY teams ask better questions to find new answers to the complex issues facing our world today.\n\n\nEY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more of the member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity.
