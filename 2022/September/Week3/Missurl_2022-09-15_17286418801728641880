        "original_content": "In 2022, Ethereum \nrenamed\n its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake from \nEthereum 2.0\n to \nThe Merge\n. The Merge \nwent live\n on Sept. 15, 2022, after the merge of the Goerli testnet successfully \ncompleted\n on Aug. 11, 2022.\nRead: \nAll you ever wanted to learn about the Ethereum Merge\n.\nThe Merge implements several critical changes to Ethereum. First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production.\nSecond, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance. This has been dubbed the \"triple halving\" in a nod to the \nBitcoin halving\n, since the Merge reduces ETH issuance by 90%. With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% \nAPR\n at current projections. Staked ETH will not be withdrawable immediately after the Merge \u2014 it will only be enabled after the Shanghai upgrade, estimated to be 6 to 12 months later.\nLearn more about the \ncommon misconceptions of Ethereum post-Merge\n.\nThe Merge will not increase transaction \nthroughput\n or reduce \ngas fees\n, as the block production rate stays roughly the same at 12 seconds (currently 13 seconds). It will also not enable \non-chain\n \ngovernance\n, with protocol changes still discussed and decided \noff-chain\n through stakeholders.\nImportantly, the transition to PoS is expected to \nreduce Ethereum's annual energy consumption\n from 112 TWh/yr to only 0.01 TWh/yr \u2014 a 99.9% drop. This reduction prompted investors to expect an influx of institutional money in a \"greener\" Ethereum. On the flip side, Ethereum \nminers\n, in an industry estimated to be worth $19 billion, seek to champion \nETHPoW\n, a potential \nhard fork\n of Ethereum on proof-of-work. We explain the main differences in our \nETH PoS vs ETH PoW article\n."
