        "original_content": " Ethereum has a long and storied history, with many developments and incidents that had significant positive changes and setbacks. In mid-September 2022, a shift from the \nproof-of-work (PoW)\n to the \nproof-of-stake (PoS)\n model occurred, bringing promises to reduce its energy footprint, increase scalability, and decrease transaction times for the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n The changes came under the moniker Ethereum 2.0, an all-encompassing term that described Ethereum\u2019s next evolution into a better-performing, more accessible network. The term is now defunct, as the \nblockchain\n community accepts the upgrade as the next step in its development, not necessarily something new.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nEthereum 2.0 significantly upgraded the Ethereum network, shifting the network to proof-of-stake from the proof-of-work model.\n\n\nEthereum 2.0 aimed to improve the network\u2019s \nscalability\n, accessibility, and transaction throughput.\n\n\nIt will take more work and several upgrades to get to the version that fulfills the promise of more than 100,000 per second and increased scalability.\n\n\n\n\n \n What Was Ethereum 2.0? \n \n\n\n \nEthereum\n 2.0 was a broad term used to cover several improvements to the Ethereum blockchain, tackling some of its most pressing technical hurdles. However, it was an informal title, and its community doesn't recognize it as a valid name for the blockchain and network. Rather, the Ethereum Foundation prefers to refer to the upgraded blockchain as Ethereum, with the consensus layer called ETH 2 and the execution layer called ETH 1.\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ethereum's developers intended to implement Ethereum 2.0 for several years, so the upgrade was not a one-off event. But, it officially kicked off with the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020, which allowed \nether (ETH)\n, the native \ntoken\n of the Ethereum network, to be staked.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The staking process entails \nlocking tokens and keeping them from being used\n in return for the privilege of participating in the network's \nconsensus\n and validation measures. Those who stake their ether receive rewards through fees paid in ETH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum uses LMD Ghost as its consensus algorithm, which uses attestation weighting to decide which blocks to use in the chain.\n3\n\n\n \n Why Move to Ethereum 2.0? \n \n\n\n This Ethereum upgrade was complex, but the network needed it for several reasons. The Ethereum network was bogged down by technical limitations\u2014namely network congestion, scalability, and accessibility.\n\n\n\n Improvements in these areas were and remain critical if Ethereum is to reach a wider level of adoption. Ethereum is the blockchain many smart-contract-based \ndecentralized applications (dApps)\n are housed on, and these have applications in finance, \nreal estate\n, supply chains, and governance, among many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n But to have the intended scalability across all industries and uses, the blockchain needed to be able to handle network interactions on a much larger scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2024, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n approved the listing of eight spot ether ETFs. These were approved for listing on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE BZX. Trading will not begin until the SEC continues with its approval process.\n4\n\n\n \n How Did Ethereum 2.0 Change Things? \n \n\n\n The Ethereum network experienced bottlenecks simply because of the amount of activity on the blockchain. For instance, the \ngas fees\n paid to miners for their work sometimes reached extraordinarily high levels. The fees improved after the upgrade occurred, as validators began staking their ether.\n\n\n\n\n\n Validators who want to run a solo validation node must lock in 32 ETH to activate it.\n5\n However, anyone can stake any amount of ETH by joining a pool or placing it in an exchange that will do it for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n PoS is faster and more eco-friendly than PoW, as it consumes far less power. This is because PoS isn't a competition to see which miner can reach the solution to the block \nhash\n first\u2014which is what needed so much energy. Instead, the network protocols randomly select which nodes get to validate transactions and open new blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter moving to PoS, energy usage lowered by roughly 99.95% and decreased average block times to about 12 seconds.\n6\n\n\n As of May 2024, the network handles about 14 transactions per second.\n7\n Despite this low number, developers still promise that it should be able to handle 100,000 transactions per second in the future.\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That level of scalability required for the vast amount of applications developers project will use the chain will be achieved through another update to the blockchain. It will use proto-danksharding and danksharding, which will replace rollups with blobs and distributed data \nsampling\n. Rollups take transactions off the chain and where they are checked, but it is costly in terms of processing by nodes because they are permanently recorded on the blockchain.\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This would bloat the blockchain, slowing the network or causing node operators to need much more powerful equipment. Blobs will not remain on the blockchain indefinitely, removing the bloat that could occur.\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWill ETH 2.0 Make ETH Worthless?\n\n\nThere is no doubt that Ethereum 2.0 was the most significant change yet for the network. It set the stage for a future where Ethereum can comfortably handle applications in various verticals and makes it more accessible to the public. The Merge occurred on Sept. 15, 2022, and ETH's price wasn't affected significantly, considering prices had already fallen across the market.\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow Much Energy Will Ethereum 2.0 Save?\n\n\nAfter shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, the energy consumption on the Ethereum network was reduced by 99.95%.\n6\n This indicates that staking is vastly more efficient than mining.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWill Ethereum 2.0 Overtake Bitcoin?\n\n\nBitcoin is designed as a payment method and is still the most popular cryptocurrency. Ethereum is a scaleable global platform intended for other developers to design blockchain-related projects. Its native token, ether, is used to pay transaction fees while happening to have market value. If this question refers to market value, it is difficult to say which will last or eventually have the most value. Likewise, it is also difficult to determine if the question is asked regarding which blockchain will garner the most use cases, developers, and end-users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n The Bottom Line \n \n\n\n With proof of stake, Ethereum has completed the biggest evolution in its history. But it's important to note that the transition to PoS didn't bring an amazing opportunity for investing or a new value to the cryptocurrency\u2014it merely transitioned the blockchain to a new way of doing things.\n\n\n\n\n\n The Ethereum Foundation described the change like this: \"Imagine Ethereum is a spaceship that isn't quite ready for an interstellar voyage. With the Beacon Chain, the community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. After significant testing, it's almost time to hot-swap the new engine for the old mid-flight.\"\n11\n The change was implemented, and developers are still working toward the final version\u2014if there will ever be a final one.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
