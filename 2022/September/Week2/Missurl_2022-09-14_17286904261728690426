Every year, bitcoin mining \nconsumes more energy than Belgium\n, according to the University of Cambridge\u2019s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Ethereum\u2019s consumption is usually pegged at roughly a third of Bitcoin\u2019s, \neven if estimates vary.\n Although some 39 percent of the energy going into bitcoin mining comes from renewable sources, \naccording to a 2020 Cambridge report,\n the industry\u2019s carbon footprint is generally regarded as unacceptable. According \nto a 2019 study\n, bitcoin mining belches out between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of CO\n2\n every year.\nThe problem is that specialized computers powered by eye-popping amounts of electricity are needed to process and verify transactions of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or Ethereum\u2019s ether on blockchains, via a process called proof-of-work mining. In this system, thousands of computers all over the world (but mostly in the US, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia) vie with each other to solve a mathematical puzzle and earn the privilege of appending a batch of transactions, or \u201cblock,\u201d to the ledger. The miner who prevails wins a crypto reward.\nAI Lab\nWIRED\u2019s resident AI expert Will Knight takes you to the cutting edge of this fast-changing field and beyond\u2014keeping you informed about where AI and technology are headed. Delivered on Wednesdays.\nMost Bitcoin advocates will tell you that proof-of-work mining is essential to keep the network secure, and would never dream of tampering with something first conceived by the currency\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. But Ethereum is on the verge of a monumental change that will substantially reduce its environmental impact.\nEthereum, launched in 2015 by a 21-year-old whiz kid named Vitalik Buterin, is about to swap proof-of-work mining for an alternative system known as proof of stake, which does not require energy-guzzling computers. The Ethereum Foundation, a research nonprofit that spearheads updates and ameliorations to the Ethereum blockchain, \nsays the shift\n will reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption by 99.5 percent. The big switcheroo is known as the Merge\u2014and it is \nslated to take place on September 14.\n\u00a0\nWhat Is the Merge?\nThe Merge hinges on the fusion of Ethereum\u2019s current proof-of-work blockchain with the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake blockchain that was \nlaunched in December 2020\n but so far has not processed any transactions.\nA couple of upgrades, scheduled to launch over the next few weeks, will lay the groundwork for a segue from one chain to the other. Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, says the way the process has been structured can be compared to a car switching from an internal combustion engine to an electric one. \u201cHow do we do that? Step one: We install an electric engine in parallel to the gasoline engine. And then\u2014step two\u2014we connect the wheels to the electric engine and turn off the gasoline engine. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to be happening at the Merge,\u201d Drake says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this parallel engine of the Beacon Chain for a year and a half\u2014and now the old \u2018gasoline\u2019 proof-of-work engine is going to be shut off.\u201d\nAfter years of delays, the Ethereum community is positive that the long-awaited shift will finally happen, following a \nsuccessful dry run carried out on a test blockchain\n, called the Goerli chain, on August 10. The fact that Buterin has a book titled \nProof of Stake\n coming out in September is probably a coincidence.\nHow Will Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake Work?\nTalking about proof of stake is a bit like talking about French cheese: There are myriad varieties\u2014with hundreds of cryptocurrencies claiming to use some version of the process. At its most basic, however, proof of stake is predicated on the idea of securing a network through incentives rather than hardware.\nIn this scenario, you don\u2019t need an expensive mining computer to partake in the network: You can use your laptop to put down a \u201cstake\u201d\u2014a certain amount of cryptocurrency locked in the network. That gives you the chance of being selected, usually via a random process, to validate a certain block and earn crypto rewards and fees. If you try to game the system, for instance by doctoring a block, the network will punish you and destroy, or \u201cslash,\u201d some or all of your stake."
