        "original_content": "Ethereum is a protocol undergoing significant changes. Client teams are upgrading the protocol to scale to meet global demand while improving security and decentralization. Beyond protocol development, a critical shift in Ethereum has been the movement away from \u2018Eth1\u2019 and \u2018Eth2\u2019 terminology.\u00a0\nAs of late 2021, core developers stopped using the terminology\n, preferring \u2018execution layer\u2019 and \u2018consensus layer\u2019, respectively. Today, as\u00a0\nhighlighted in our Q1 roadmap\n,\u00a0\nethereum.org\n\u00a0makes the same shift.\n\n\nEth1 \u2192 execution layer\nEth2 \u2192 consensus layer\nExecution layer + consensus layer = Ethereum\n\n\nLet\u2019s explore why.\n\n\nTl;dr;\n\n\nThe terms Eth1 and Eth2 (Ethereum 2.0) are being phased out\nExecution layer (Eth1) and consensus layer (Eth2) are the new terminologies\nThe roadmap to scale Ethereum in a decentralized way remains the same\nYou don\u2019t need to do anything\n\n\nWhere did Ethereum 2.0 come from?\n\n\nEthereum always had, as part of its roadmap,\u00a0\nplans to scale the network in a decentralized way\n\u00a0and to\u00a0\ntransition to proof-of-stake\n. Early on, researchers worked on these efforts separately, but around 2018 they were\u00a0\ncombined into a single roadmap under the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d umbrella\n.\n\n\nAs part of that roadmap, the existing proof-of-work chain (Eth1) would eventually be deprecated via the difficulty bomb. Users & applications would migrate to a new, proof-of-stake Ethereum chain, known as Eth2.\n\n\nThe article \nThe Roadmap to Serenity\n by ConsenSys explains how things stood as of early 2019.\n\n\nWhat changed?\n\n\nAs work began on the \nBeacon Chain\n, it became clear that the phased Ethereum 2.0 roadmap would take several years to deliver fully. This led to a revival of research initiatives on the proof-of-work chain such as Stateless Ethereum, a paradigm that would remove the untouched state from the network to bound its growth rate.\n\n\nThe increased focus on making the proof-of-work chain long-term sustainable paired with the realization that the Beacon Chain would be ready much earlier than other components of the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap led to an\u00a0\n\"Early Merge\" proposal\n. This proposal would launch the existing EVM chain as \"Shard 0\" of the Ethereum 2.0 system. Not only would this expedite the move to proof-of-stake, but it would also make for a much smoother transition for applications, as the move to proof-of-stake could happen without any migration on their end.\n\n\nShortly after this proposal, Danny Ryan explored how we could accomplish this by leveraging the existing Eth1 clients in his\u00a0\nEth1+Eth2 client relationship\n\u00a0post. This would massively reduce the development work required to deliver a post-merge system and leverage existing clients, which had been battle-tested for years on Mainnet. Around the same time,\u00a0\nresearch on rollups\n\u00a0as a viable and secure way to scale Ethereum proved promising. Instead of waiting on a complex, uncertain scaling solution years away, we could shift the focus towards scaling via rollups instead of sharded execution.\n\n\nWant to dive deeper? Check out Danny Ryan\u2019s \n\u201cEth1 + Eth2 = Ethereum\u201d ETHGlobal presentation\n.\n\n\nWhy can\u2019t we just use Eth2?\n\n\nMental models\n\n\nOne major problem with the Eth2 branding is that it creates a broken mental model for new users of Ethereum. They intuitively think that Eth1 comes first and Eth2 comes after. Or that Eth1 ceases to exist once Eth2 exists. Neither of these is true. By removing Eth2 terminology, we save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.\n\n\nInclusivity\n\n\nAs the roadmap for Ethereum has evolved, Ethereum 2.0 has become an inaccurate representation of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap. Being careful and accurate in our word choice allows content on Ethereum to be understood by the broadest audience possible.\n\n\nScam prevention\n\n\nUnfortunately, malicious actors have attempted to use the Eth2 misnomer to scam users by telling them to swap their ETH for \u2018ETH2\u2019 tokens or that they must somehow migrate their ETH before the Eth2 upgrade.\n\n\nWe hope this updated terminology will bring clarity to eliminate this scam vector and help make the ecosystem safer.\n\n\nStaking clarity\n\n\nSome staking operators have also represented ETH staked on the Beacon Chain with the \u2018ETH2\u2019 ticker. This creates potential confusion, given that users of these services are not actually receiving an \u2018ETH2\u2019 token. No \u2018ETH2\u2019 token exists; it simply represents their share in that specific providers\u2019 stake.\n\n\nHow does this update change the Ethereum roadmap?\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t! It\u2019s important to understand that this renaming represents a change in naming only. The features on Ethereum\u2019s current roadmap (i.e. \nthe merge\n, \nsharding\n) and future features will still happen on the same timeline. \nMore on the Ethereum upgrades\n.\n\n\n\n\nContent changes\n\n\nethereum.org\n\n\nOur \u2018Eth2\u2019 resources (ethereum.org/en/eth2) are now our \u2018Ethereum upgrades\u2019 section\n\n\nIndividual features are now referred to as \u2018upgrades\u2019\n\n\nAll pages previously discussing Eth2 have been updated, with explanations included where appropriate\n\n\nThe rebrand was a massive task with many content changes. There are likely instances we missed and improvements still to be made. Notice something that needs fixing?\u00a0\nRaise an issue or open a PR on the ethereum.org GitHub\n.\n\n\nStaking Launchpad\n\n\nUpdate February 1, 2022\n\n\nAs part of the great renaming, we've also updated the \nEthereum Staking Launchpad\n (formerly known as the Eth2 Launchpad) to reflect the terminology changes. \nPlease raise an issue or create a PR if we missed anything\n.\n\n\nContent translations\n\n\nIf you\u2019re capable of translating content, we could use your help! We\u2019ve updated this content in English, but our 40+ additional languages are now outdated and still reference Eth2 terminology. Please consider getting involved.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve updated our\u00a0\ncontent buckets\n\u00a0to include an Ethereum upgrades bucket. This will empower our hundreds of active contributors to the Translation Program to directly target these changes to publish the new accurate information across languages more quickly.\n\n\nInterested in helping to translate\u00a0ethereum.org or the Ethereum Staking Launchpad? Check out\u00a0\nour translation program\n.\n\n\nA final note\n\n\nTo many,\u00a0ethereum.org\u00a0is seen as a credible source of information maintained by our community. Understandably, many didn\u2019t want to shift away from Eth2 terminology until ethereum.org did. We hope that our changes will encourage others to move away from the outdated Eth2 terminology. By doing so, you will be helping to create consistency and clarity across the ecosystem, allowing for more accurate mental models and making Ethereum more accessible.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to \nTim Beiko\n and \nTrent Van Epps\n whose writings were heavily referenced in this article."
