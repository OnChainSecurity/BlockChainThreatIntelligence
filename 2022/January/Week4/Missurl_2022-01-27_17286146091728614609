        "original_content": "The world's second-most\n popular cryptocurrency isn't an investment vehicle, at least according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. William Hinman, the agency's director of the division of corporate finance, \nsaid\n Thursday that ether\u2014the currency that powers the \nEthereum network\n\u2014shouldn't be regulated in the same way as stocks and bonds.\nHis statements follow similar ones \nmade in April\n by SEC chair Jay Clayton about bitcoin. Taken together, the two sets of remarks provide the clearest understanding of how the regulatory agency views the cryptocurrency market. In essence, when a cryptocurrency becomes sufficiently decentralized, as the widely popular bitcoin and ether have, the agency no longer views it as a security. In contrast, smaller initial coin offerings, or ICOs, \nare\n almost always securities in the SEC's eyes. That distinction matters, because securities are subject to the same regulations as normal stocks.\nAI Lab\nWIRED\u2019s resident AI expert Will Knight takes you to the cutting edge of this fast-changing field and beyond\u2014keeping you informed about where AI and technology are headed. Delivered on Wednesdays.\n\u201cBased on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network, and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions,\u201d Hinman said at \nYahoo's All Market Summit: Crypto\n in San Francisco. \"And, as with bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in ether would seem to add little value.\"\nJoe Lubin, a cofounder of Ethereum and the founder of CosenSys, a major Ethereum application company, says he is grateful for the SEC's decision. \"We applaud the clarity provided by Director Hinman and the SEC today,\" Lubin said in a statement. \"Ether and other next-generation consumer utility tokens will continue evolving the web towards networks that are more fair, secure, and evenly distributed. ConsenSys looks forward to continuing to engage with regulators around the globe to promote responsible adoption of this transformative technology.\"\nHundreds of different developers run applications on top of the Ethereum network and contribute to its code. A similar number, if not more, help to develop Bitcoin. \"The network and the software development is sufficiently decentralized that there isn't a discernible third party upon whom we would really expect investors to be reliant,\" says Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at \nCoin Center\n, a think tank focused on policy issues facing blockchain technology. That's an important distinction from traditional securities, like Apple or Microsoft stock, in which you're betting on a specific company's efforts to develop products and services and generate income.\nThe SEC's Hinman notably stopped short of declaring that the initial investments made in ether weren't securities. It's possible that investments made early, before the currency became truly decentralized, could still be viewed as traditional investment vehicles. \"The director was pretty clear to not be definitive about that activity,\" says Van Valkenberg, who also suggests that this indicates the people who got in first\u2014and have likely made the most money\u2014could someday face regulation.\nHinman also said that other cryptocurrencies may become \"sufficiently decentralized\" in the future, to the point where \"regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required.\" But this doesn't mean all cryptocurrencies can evade scrutiny from US regulators. The SEC has held that most so-called token sales and ICOs are likely subject to regulation, because they generally power a single startup's product or application. ICOs are opportunities for investors to purchase the tokens that power a blockchain startup, typically before its product has gone live."
