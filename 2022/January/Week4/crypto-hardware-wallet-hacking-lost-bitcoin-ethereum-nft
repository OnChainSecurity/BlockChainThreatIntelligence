        "original_content": "Cracking a $2 million crypto wallet\nFirst, he forgot his PIN - then he started looking for hackersIn early 2018, Dan Reich and a friend decided to spend $50,000 in Bitcoin on a batch of Theta tokens, a new cryptocurrency then worth just 21 cents apiece. At first, they held the tokens with an exchange based in China, but within weeks, a broad crackdown on cryptocurrency by the Chinese government meant they would soon lose access to the exchange, so they had to transfer everything to a hardware wallet. Reich and his friend chose a Trezor One hardware wallet, set up a PIN, and then got busy with life and forgot about it.\n\nBy the end of that year, the token had sunk to less than a quarter of its value, come back up, and then crashed again. Reich decided he wanted to cash out, but his friend had lost the paper where he\u2019d written the PIN and couldn\u2019t remember the digits. They tried guessing what they thought was a four-digit PIN (it was actually five), but after each failed attempt, the wallet doubled the wait time before they could guess again. After 16 guesses, the data on the wallet would automatically erase. When they reached a dozen tries, they stopped, afraid to go further.Reich gave up and wrote off the money in his mind. He was willing to take the loss - until the price started to rise again.\n\nFrom a low of around $12,000, the value of their tokens started to skyrocket. By the end of 2020, it would be worth more than $400,000, rising briefly to over $3 million. It would be hard to get into the wallet without the PIN - but it wasn\u2019t impossible. And with potentially millions on the line, Reich and his friend vowed to find a way inside. \n\nThe only way to own cryptocurrency on the blockchain is to have sole possession of a private key associated with a block of currency - but managing those keys has been a, sometimes high-stakes, challenge from the beginning. You can\u2019t sell or spend your currency without the key (or the string of words used to derive the key, also called the seed) - but if anyone else gets hold of it, they can grab your coins in a single anonymous transaction from anywhere in the world. You can store your key in a software wallet on an exchange service\u2019s server or in a software wallet on your own computer or mobile phone - but those are vulnerable to remote attack if anyone on the internet is able to get your key.\n\nHardware wallets, the size of a USB stick, are meant to solve that problem, storing the key locally, off the internet, and signing transactions inside the secure wallet when you insert the device into a computer and enter the PIN. But if you forget the PIN and don\u2019t have the key written down, you\u2019re generally out of luck and can no longer access your currency on the blockchain.\n\nmore than 3.7 million Bitcoins are lost to owners\n\nThis happens more often than you might think. The cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis estimates that more than 3.7 million Bitcoins worth $66.5 billion are likely lost to owners. Currency can be lost for many reasons: the computer or phone storing a software wallet is stolen or crashes and the wallet is unrecoverable; the owner inadvertently throws their hardware wallet away; or the owner forgets their PIN or dies without passing it to family members.\n\nAs the value of their inaccessible tokens rapidly rose in 2020, Reich and his friend were desperate to crack their wallet. They searched online until they found a 2018 conference talk from three hardware experts who discovered a way to access the key in a Trezor wallet without knowing the PIN. The engineers declined to help them, but it gave Reich hope.\n\n\n\"We at least knew that it was possible and had some directional idea of how it could be done,\" Reich says.\n\nThen they found a financier in Switzerland who claimed he had associates in France who could crack the wallet in a lab. But there was a catch: Reich couldn\u2019t know their names or go to the lab. He\u2019d have to hand off his wallet to the financier in Switzerland, who would take it to his French associates. It was a crazy idea with a lot of risks, but Reich and his friend were desperate. \n\nCOVID and lockdowns slowed their plans in 2020, but in February 2021, with the value of their tokens now $2.5 million, Reich was making plans to fly to Europe, when suddenly they found a better option: a hardware hacker in the US named Joe Grand.\n\nGrand is an electrical engineer and inventor who has been hacking hardware since he was 10. Known by the hacker handle \"Kingpin,\" he was part of the famed L0pht hacker collective that, in 1998, testified to the US Senate about a vulnerability that could be used to take down the internet or allow an intelligence agency to spy on traffic. In 2008, he co-hosted the Discovery Channel\u2019s \"Prototype This\" show and currently teaches hardware hacking to organizations and companies that design complex systems and want to understand how hackers can attack their products.\n\n\"If he screwed something up, there was a good shot that it would never be able to be recovered\"\n\nReich, an electrical engineer himself who owns a software company, had a better ability than most to assess if Grand had the skills to pull off the hack. After a single conversation, he knew they\u2019d found the right person. \"I remember thinking, \u2018Wow, this is perhaps one of the brightest electrical engineers I\u2019ve ever met,\u2019\" he recalls.\n\nGrand, who has a custom lab in his family\u2019s Portland backyard, purchased several identical wallets to the one Reich and his friend owned and installed the same version of firmware on them. Then he spent three months doing research and attacking his practice wallets with various techniques. They agreed that Reich, who lives in New Jersey, wouldn\u2019t fly out to Portland with his wallet until Grand succeeded to crack three wallets using the same technique.\n"
