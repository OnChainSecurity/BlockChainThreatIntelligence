As such, it concluded that the projects may execute a so-called \u201crug pull\u201d on their investors.\u00a0\n\u201cRug pull\u201d is a popular term used to describe crypto exit scams in which teams abandon projects or sell tokens on exchanges and disappear with investors\u2019 funds.\nPeckShield listed the projects it had identified in a \nThursday tweet\n. The firm highlighted that the smart contracts for the tokens are designed in such a way that users can buy but not sell their holdings, creating a \u201choneypot\u201d scenario. Tokens that employ a honeypot mechanism typically rise in value as more investors buy in before they find out that they cannot liquidate their positions. The token creator can then pull the rug and run off with the funds. Several scam projects have adopted a honeypot strategy to steal investors\u2019 funds in recent weeks. In one high-profile case, a project styling itself on the hit Netflix show\n Squid Gam\ne launched a token called SQUID on Binance Smart Chain. It rallied thousands of percent in a few days before plummeting to zero when the team pulled the rug, making off with about $12 million.\u00a0\nPeckShield told Crypto Briefing that it \u201cdecided to warn the community earlier rather than later\u201d following a discussion with the team at Binance Smart Chain. Discussing how the listed tokens share common issues, PeckShield explained:\n\u201cEach token owner\u2019s authority is too large and most of these tokens have too few sellers. Moreover, when interacting with PancakeSwap, the selling may be restricted.\u201d\nThe good news is that 54 of the 55 flagged projects do not have active users or value locked on them. O\nne token using the ticker symbol \nTRUMP\n has some on-chain activity and about \n$29,500\n in liquidity on PancakeSwap. The TRUMP token has about 271 holders and has recorded a trading volume of $144,860 over the course of last week.\u00a0\n\n\nIn a separate \ntweet\n, PeckShield warned Binance Smart Chain users against trading TRUMP. The post described it as a \u201chigh-risk token\u201d because it lets the owner mint unlimited tokens. \nCrypto Briefing investigated the project and could not source the team\u2019s website, or social media channels.\nRug pulls have been a recurring problem for Binance Smart Chain users in recent months. In addition to Squid Game, several other scam projects launched on the network in 2021, resulting in users losing millions of dollars worth of funds. Among the biggest attacks involved TurtleDex and MetaDAO, which respectively stole $2.4 million and $3.2 million from their users.\nThe trend has continued into 2022, too. The security firm RugDoc \nreported\n Wednesday that multiple Binance Smart Chain tokens had \u201crugged\u201d users after launching Initial DEX Offerings on the network. While Binance Smart Chain has hosted many malicious crypto teams, it\u2019s not the only network that\u2019s seen a wave of rug pulls. As the crypto space has grown, Ethereum has become a hub for similar incidents. Most recently, an anonymous team called\n\u00a0\nEtherWrapped\n lured Ethereum users in with a fake New Year\u2019s Eve airdrop then pulled the rug. They made off with 30 ETH.\u00a0\n\n\n\n"
