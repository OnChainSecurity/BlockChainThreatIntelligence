        "original_content": "There's a new spin on scammers asking people to pay with cryptocurrency. It involves an \nimpersonator\n,\u00a0a QR code, and a trip to a store (directed by a scammer on the phone) to send your money to them through a cryptocurrency ATM.\n\n\nIt works like this: someone might call pretending to be from the government, law enforcement, or a local utility company. Maybe a romantic interest you met online calls, or someone calls to say you\u2019ve won the lottery or a prize. They\u2019ll wind up asking you for money. If you believe the story they tell and you seem willing to engage, they\u2019ll stay on the phone to direct you to withdraw money from your bank, investment, or retirement accounts. Then they\u2019ll tell you to go to a store with a cryptocurrency ATM (and they\u2019ll stay on the phone the whole time). Once you\u2019re there, they\u2019ll direct you to insert your money into the ATM and buy cryptocurrency. Here\u2019s where the QR code comes in: they send you a QR code with their address embedded in it. Once you buy the cryptocurrency, they have you scan the code so the money gets transferred to them. But then your money is gone.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the main thing to know: nobody from the government, law enforcement, utility company, or prize promoter will ever tell you to pay them with cryptocurrency. If someone does, it\u2019s a scam, every time. Any unexpected tweet, text, email, call, or social media message \u2014 particularly from someone you don\u2019t know \u2014 asking you to pay them in advance for something, including with cryptocurrency, is a scam.\n\n\nIf you spot something like this, tell the FTC right away at \nReportFraud.ftc.gov\n.
