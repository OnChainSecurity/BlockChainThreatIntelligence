Many stories are surfacing about how OpenSea\u2019s broken policy is damaging innocent NFT traders by penalizing them for unverified activities and not allowing them to trade their assets.\n\nThe leading NFT marketplace freezes digital collectibles and blocks numerous accounts without digging deeper. OpenSea users say that after they try to communicate with the platform about the issue, the team usually refuses to cooperate, responding to requests with the equivalent of \"sorry, good luck.\"\n\nAfter using his savings to purchase a CrypToadz NFT, an OpenSea user named zamunda.eth had his NFT reported by a previous owner who had lost it as collateral for a loan. An anonymous collector borrowed some Ethereum from the NFTfi loan marketplace to buy NFTs, and when he failed to pay the loan back, the NFTs he owned were sent back to the lender. In this case, the lender who got the CrypToad back from the borrower sold the NFT to zamunda.eth. Consequently, the borrower reported the NFT, which is now marked as suspicious on OpenSea and is frozen. The anonymous collector has allegedly reported several NFTs he used to own.\n\n\nTwitter user iFurthur also fell victim to OpenSea\u2019s careless policy. After submitting a ticket to the marketplace\u2019s support team for negatively flagging his NFT, he got an answer, \"we\u2019re sorry to hear that, but will refund the 2.5% commission on that sale.\"\n\ngm to everyone except @opensea - looks like I\u2019m the latest to fall victim to their misguided \"reported for suspicious activity\" policy. I bought a NFT for 2 eth on OpenSea that was then flagged TWO DAYS LATER for sus activity and now can\u2019t be traded\n\n- furthur (@iFurthur) July 22, 2022\nOpenSea locks a large number of Bored Ape Yacht Club and other blue chip NFTs\nLess than a month ago, a user named Beetle compiled a list of 130 BAYC NFTs that have been marked as suspicious. Some of them are possibly stolen, while the rest could be locked for any reason.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s \u2018reported for suspicious activity\u2019 feature often misused\nSource: Dune Analytics\n\nAccording to Degenpost, OpenSea has blacklisted over 24,000 ETH (almost $34 million) worth of NFTs. Another source stated that 268 MAYC, 153 Azukis, 202 CloneX, and 70 Moonbirds are flagged for suspicious activity.\n\nOne NFT collector tweeted a dark prediction for the near future of OpenSea, foreseeing users teaming up to file complaints against the NFT giant and plan to move to other, better-organized NFT platforms.\n\nThe year is 2024.\n\nThere are only 40 NFTs left on Opensea, everything else has been reported for suspicious activity\n\nNFTs are ded & the merge is just around the corner\n\n- MT1000 (@MT1000_) July 24, 2022\nOpenSea\u2019s suspicious feature is necessary, as NFTs often get stolen. However, the company must carry out due diligence when searching for evidence that an NFT was involved in malicious activity. To improve the company and NFT sales, OpenSea needs to react quickly to recover NFTs that were wrongfully reported, or at least have more people report on an NFT for a digital collectible to be blocked and flagged as suspicious.\n\nUpdate\nOpenSea\u2019s frozen asset policy is completely exploited. Market analyst NFTinit.com noted that scammers try to report their sold NFTs as \u2018stolen\u2019 to get them back for cheaper prices, as they can no longer be traded on the marketplace. If a seller regrets selling an NFT after its floor price increases, they can flag the asset as suspicious and return it. Such practice is severely hurting genuine NFT buyers, while hackers get away after liquidating assets most of the time. OpenSea have been disregarding customer rights and needs to fix the problem immediately.\n\n\nRead related posts:\n\nChainalysis offers early look at report on Web3 Theft, Money Laundering, and more\nMobile app rewards users in crypto for working out\nOpenSea Acquires NFT Aggregator Gem to Improve User Experience\nTags:\nEthereum\nNFT\nNFT marketplace\nOpenSea\nDisclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, please note that the information provided on this page is not intended to be and should not be interpreted as legal, tax, investment, financial, or any other form of advice.
