Image: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain analysis firm Chainalysis said 2022 was \"the biggest year ever\" in terms of the number of crypto projects hit with attacks and drained of funds-and that was in October. It certainly felt like it.\n\n\nJust the hacks highlighted here add up to an enormous $2.07 billion, and these hacks represent only a small portion of the total attacks observed in 2023.\n\n\nThe seeming lack of security this year has made an already brutal bear market even tougher for many. Chainalysis tells Decrypt that a full accounting of the year will be included in a wrap-up report next year. (Figures in this piece represent the value of the funds at the time of the incident.)\n\n1. Binance (Binance Smart Chain): $566 million \nHackers hit a blockchain associated with the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange on October 6, making away with $566 million in BNB.\n\nThe exploit targeted the cross-chain bridge BSC Token Hub. Hackers essentially conjured tokens out of nothing using artificial withdrawal proofs. No users of Binance or its blockchain lost funds in this attack, though. \n\nDespite the huge amount of tokens pinched, the criminals weren\u2019t able to pocket them all-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said they were able to prevent around 80% to 90% of the targeted funds from being taken by the hacker.\n\nThis is because BSC chain validators froze the network following the attack-but hackers did manage to move around $100 million in funds to other chains.\n\nAD\n\n2. Ronin: $552 million \nHackers hit Ronin, a sidechain for the popular NFT game Axie Infinity, in March, pinching an estimated $552 million in Ethereum and USDC. When the exploit was disclosed by Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis one week later, the value of the funds stolen had risen to $622 million.\n\nHow\u2019d they do it? By using \"hacked private keys\" to forge transactions and claim the funds. \n\nAxie Infinity\nThe funds were laundered quickly-as they typically are in hacks-with around $7 million in Ethereum sent to cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash (now banned by U.S. government).\n\nThe U.S. Treasury later identified wallet addresses allegedly tied to North Korea\u2019s Lazarus hacking group in the attack.\n\n3. FTX: $446 million \nIt\u2019s been the biggest crypto event-and arguably the biggest news story-of 2022: super-popular digital asset exchange FTX spectacularly collapsed, losing billions of dollars worth of funds. \n\nIt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy November 12, but that wasn\u2019t the end of its woes: the celebrity-endorsed exchange was then hit by a mystery attack. \n\n\nAD\n\nSeveral wallets allegedly belonging to FTX were drained of around $446 million in tokens. The funds were then moved around to other exchanges and converted into different cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd it still isn\u2019t clear who stole the assets. At the collapsed exchange\u2019s first court hearing, counsel to FTX\u2019s new management James Bromley said that a \"substantial amount\" of the exchange's assets are missing or have been stolen. \n\n4. Wormhole: $326 million \nDecentralized finance protocols got hit hard this year. DeFi is the catch-all term for apps that automate things banks and brokerages do, and they are still new and experimental. This means security is an issue, particularly with bridges, which allow users to transfer funds between chains. \n\nA bank vault.

While DeFi comes with high rewards, it also carries plenty of risks.  Since just about anyone can spin up a DeFi protocol and write some smart contracts, flaws in the code are common. And in DeFi, there are many unscrupulous actors ready and able to exploit those flaws. When that happens, millions of dollars are put on the line, often with no...\n\nDeep Dives\nLong Reads\n10 min read\nEkin Gen\u00e7, Stephen Graves\nApr 19, 2022\nIn February, the popular bridge Wormhole got hit with an exploit. Hackers targeted its leg on Solana (where users must first lock Ethereum into a smart contract to get an equivalent amount in Wrapped Ethereum, or WETH) to mint tokens. 120,000 in WETH tokens, to be exact. At the time, that was $326 million. \n\nWormhole\nWETH is token pegged to the price of Ethereum on a 1:1 basis, useful in the DeFi world for moving around funds quickly. \n\nJump Trading, Wormhole\u2019s parent company and a major player in the Solana ecosystem, was able to step in and save the day by replacing what was stolen and getting the bridge up and running again. \n\n5. Nomad: $190 million \nAnother bridge got hit in August. Nomad, which lets users move digital assets between different blockchains, lost all its funds-held in Ethereum, USDC, DAI, FXS, and CQT-after hackers took advantage of a bug in the upgrade. \n\nAD\n\n\nAfter those behind the protocol offered a 10% reward to hackers who returned the tokens-without enforcing law enforcement-funds started to trickle back in. \n\nAbout $22 million was recovered but the attack prompted the FBI to warn investors about how cyber criminals were eying up vulnerable DeFi platforms like never before. \n\nEditor's note: This article was revised with a new total amount stolen in the FTX hack after Chainalysis provided Decrypt with an updated figure.\n\nDaily Debrief Newsletter\nStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.\nYour Email\nyou@emailaddress.com\n\nGet it!\n\n\n\n\n\nIPFS\nIPFS\n"
