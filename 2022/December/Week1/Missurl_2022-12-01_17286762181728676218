For many, the solution to preventing theft has been \nstowing items away under lock-and-key\n \u2014 but experts have said that measure \npushes customers away from stores and reduces sales.\n\n\nProject Unlock has two main components. First, products are loaded with RFID tags that have unique serial numbers. When customers check out, a scanner reads all tags on the products, and if they have the correct serial number, the product is activated at sale. Otherwise, without this point-of-sale activation, the product is inoperable.\nAdditionally, Project Unlock focuses on transparent purchase records. More specifically, the company said it is utilizing blockchain technology to create a \"secure publicly accessible anonymized record of authentic product purchases.\"\nEssentially, when a product is purchased, it is recorded in the blockchain \u2014 or a system in which a record of transactions is maintained across computers that are linked. And if a thief tries to resell stolen goods to other individuals or third-party marketplaces, potential buyers can check to make sure they're not buying a stolen good.\n\"We see a future in which technologies like Project Unlock can help the entire retail ecosystem create a great environment for our customers,\" the company said.\u00a0\nLowe's isn't the first company to get creative with anti-theft measures. In 2021, Home Depot \nbegan selling power tools\u00a0that won't work\n\u00a0unless they're properly scanned and activated at the register via Bluetooth technology.\nLowe's didn't immediately respond to Insider's inquiries about when it plans a full rollout of Project Unlock.\n\n\n\n"
