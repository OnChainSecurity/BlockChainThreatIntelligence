        "original_content": "Reports show scammers cashing in on crypto craze\nBy Emma Fletcher\nJune 3, 2022\nFacebookTwitterLinkedIn\nFrom Super Bowl ads to Bitcoin ATMs, cryptocurrency seems to be everywhere lately. Although it\u2019s yet to become a mainstream payment method, reports to the FTC show it\u2019s an alarmingly common method for scammers to get peoples\u2019 money. Since the start of 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams[1] - that\u2019s about one out of every four dollars reported lost,[2] more than any other payment method. The median individual reported loss? A whopping $2,600. The top cryptocurrencies people said they used to pay scammers were Bitcoin (70%), Tether (10%), and Ether (9%).[3]  \n\nCrypto has several features that are attractive to scammers, which may help to explain why the reported losses in 2021 were nearly sixty times what they were in 2018. There\u2019s no bank or other centralized authority to flag suspicious transactions and attempt to stop fraud before it happens. Crypto transfers can\u2019t be reversed - once the money\u2019s gone, there\u2019s no getting it back. And most people are still unfamiliar with how crypto works. These considerations are not unique to crypto transactions, but they all play into the hands of scammers.\n\nReports point to social media and crypto as a combustible combination for fraud. Nearly half the people who reported losing crypto to a scam since 2021 said it started with an ad, post, or message on a social media platform.[4]\n\nImage\nReported Cryptocurrency Fraud Loss by year\nDuring this period, nearly four out of every ten dollars reported lost to a fraud originating on social media was lost in crypto, far more than any other payment method.[5] The top platforms identified in these reports were Instagram (32%), Facebook (26%), WhatsApp (9%), and Telegram (7%).[6]\n\nOf the reported crypto fraud losses that began on social media, most are investment scams.[7] Indeed, since 2021, $575 million of all crypto fraud losses reported to the FTC were about bogus investment opportunities, far more than any other fraud type. The stories people share about these scams describe a perfect storm: false promises of easy money paired with people\u2019s limited crypto understanding and experience. Investment scammers claim they can quickly and easily get huge returns for investors. But those crypto \"investments\" go straight to a scammer\u2019s wallet. People report that investment websites and apps let them track the growth of their crypto, but it\u2019s all fake. Some people report making a small \"test\" withdrawal - just enough to convince them it\u2019s safe to go all in. When they really try to cash out, they\u2019re told to send more crypto for (fake) fees, and they don\u2019t get any of their money back.\n\nRomance scams are a distant second to investment scams, with $185 million in reported cryptocurrency losses since 2021 - that\u2019s nearly one in every three dollars reported lost to a romance scam during this period.[8] And many have an investment twist too. These keyboard Casanovas reportedly dazzle people with their supposed wealth and sophistication. Before long, they casually offer tips on getting started with crypto investing and help with making investments. People who take them up on the offer report that what they really got was a tutorial on sending crypto to a scammer. The median individual reported crypto loss to romance scammers is an astounding $10,000.\n\n\n\n \n\nBusiness and government impersonation scams are next with $133 million in reported crypto losses since 2021. These scams can start with a text about a supposedly unauthorized Amazon purchase, or an alarming online pop-up made to look like a security alert from Microsoft. From there, people are reportedly told the fraud is extensive and their money is at risk. The scammers may even get the \"bank\" on the line to back up the story. (Pro tip: it\u2019s not the bank.) In another twist, scammers impersonating border patrol agents have reportedly told people their accounts will be frozen as part of a drug trafficking investigation. These scammers tell people the only way to protect their money is to put it in crypto: people report that these \"agents\" direct them to take out cash and feed it into a crypto ATM. The \"agent\" then sends a QR code and says to hold it up to the ATM camera. But that QR code is embedded with the scammer\u2019s wallet address. Once the machine scans it, their cash is gone.\n\nPeople ages 20 to 49 were more than three times as likely as older age groups to have reported losing cryptocurrency to a scammer.[9] Reports point to people in their 30s as the hardest hit - 35% of their reported fraud losses since 2021 were in cryptocurrency.[10] But median individual reported losses have tended to increase with age, topping out at $11,708 for people in their 70s.[11]\n\nHere are some things to know to steer clear of a crypto con:\n\nOnly scammers will guarantee profits or big returns. No cryptocurrency investment is ever guaranteed to make money, let alone big money.\nNobody legit will require you to buy cryptocurrency. Not to sort out a problem, not to protect your money. That\u2019s a scam.\nNever mix online dating and investment advice. If a new love interest wants to show you how to invest in crypto, or asks you to send them crypto, that\u2019s a scam.\nTo learn more about cryptocurrency scams - and how to spot and avoid scams generally - visit ftc.gov/cryptocurrency and ftc.gov/scams.

Reports provided by Sentinel data contributors are excluded because of inconsistencies among contributors in capturing payment information. Because the vast majority of frauds are not reported, these figures reflect just a small fraction of the public harm. See Anderson, K. B., To Whom Do Victims of Mass-Market Consumer Fraud Complain? at 1 (May 2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3852323 (study showed only 4.8% of people who experienced mass-market consumer fraud complained to a Better Business Bureau or a government entity).\n\n[2] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, cryptocurrency was identified as the payment method for 24% of reported dollar losses in fraud reports to the FTC.\n\n[3]These figures exclude reports that did not specify the type of cryptocurrency.\n\n[4] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, 49% of fraud reports to the FTC indicating cryptocurrency as the payment method specified that the scam started on social media, compared to 37% in 2020, 18% in 2019, and 11% in 2018.\n\n[5] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, $1.1 billion was reported to the FTC as lost to fraud originating on social media. Of that number, 39% was reported as paid using cryptocurrency, followed by bank transfer or payment (20%), and wire transfer (9%). 8% did not indicate a payment method.\n\n[6] These figures exclude reports that did not specify a social media platform.\n\n[7] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, people reported to the FTC that $417 million in cryptocurrency was lost to fraud originating on social media. $273 million of these losses were to fraud categorized as investment related, followed by romance scams ($69 million), and business imposters ($35 million).\n\n[8] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, cryptocurrency was identified as the payment method for 29% of reported dollar losses to romance scams.\n\n[9] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, people ages 20 to 49 submitted fraud loss reports to the FTC indicating social media as the contact method at a rate 3.4 times greater than people 50 and over. About 91% of fraud reports indicating cryptocurrency as the payment method during this period included age information. This age comparison is normalized based on the number of loss reports per million population by age during this period. Population numbers were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States (June 2020).\n\n[10] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the percentage of total reported fraud losses that were lost in cryptocurrency by age were as follows: 12% (18-19), 23% (20-29), 35% (30-39), 33% (40-49), 28% (50-59), 19% (60-69), 10% (70-79), and 2% (80 and over). These figures exclude reports that did not indicate age.\n\n[11] From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the median individual reported cryptocurrency losses to fraud by age were as follows: $1,000 (18-19), $1,600 (20-29), $2,500 (30-39), $3,200 (40-49), $5,000 (50-59), $8,500 (60-69), $11,708 (70-79), and $8,100 (80 and over).\n\nFile\nData Spotlight: Reports show scammers cashing in on crypto craze (336.43 KB)\nSubscribe\nGet blog updates by email.\n\nArchives\nAugust 2024 (1)\nMay 2024 (1)\nApril 2024 (1)\nOctober 2023 (1)\nMay 2023 (1)\nFebruary 2023 (1)\nNovember 2022 (1)\nJune 2022 (1)\nFebruary 2022 (1)\nJanuary 2022 (1)\nView More\nMore from the Data Spotlight\nData Spotlight\nBitcoin ATMs: A payment portal for scammers\nEmma Fletcher\nSeptember 3, 2024\nData Spotlight\nWho\u2019s who in scams: a spring roundup\nEmma Fletcher\nMay 24, 2024\nData Spotlight\nImpersonation scams: not what they used to be\nApril 1, 2024\nData Spotlight\nSocial media: a golden goose for scammers\nEmma Fletcher\nOctober 6, 2023\nGet Business Blog updates\nEnter your email to subscribe to Business Center Blog"
