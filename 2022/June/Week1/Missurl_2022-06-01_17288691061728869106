        "original_content": "NFTs have become a cultural phenomenon over the past year, constantly making headlines as celebrities dabble in the space and as \nshenanigans\n, \nscams\n, and \nlegal fights\n ensue. While it\u2019s hard to tell if they will retain or regain their popularity after a market slump or two, there are still plenty of reasons someone might want to try their hand at making one. Who can resist a field that creators \nhave made millions from\n?\nWe\u2019re going to go over how to create an NFT using two of the most popular marketplaces, but before we get to that point, let\u2019s cover some of the basics of what an NFT is and the decisions you may have to make before deciding to sell one. (If you\u2019re relatively up to speed, you can go to Step 3 to begin the journey of actually creating a token.)\nStep 1: Figure out what an NFT is\nListen, there\u2019s no judgment if you\u2019ve arrived here without much understanding of what NFTs are. Maybe a friend said, \u201cHey, you should sell that picture of your cat as an NFT.\u201d But before you go through the process of creating and selling one, it\u2019s probably best to have some idea about what you\u2019re doing.\nWe have an \nentire explainer going into NFTs\n and the culture around them, as well as an explainer on \nthe blockchain technology that NFTs use\n. You don\u2019t have to study every word in them, but the rest of this guide will make references to things like Ethereum, proof of work, and other similar concepts that you\u2019ll get a better understanding of by reading our explainers.\nHere\u2019s a quick TL;DR, though. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital tokens stored on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, where each coin is the same (there\u2019s no reason to prefer one particular Bitcoin over another), each NFT is unique and can be sold as a way to prove ownership over some sort of digital file.\nNFT artwork is almost never actually stored on the blockchain\nIn almost every case, the files \naren\u2019t actually stored on the blockchain itself\n. Rather, a link to the file is stored, along with the token that acts as proof of ownership over whatever that link points to. There\u2019s also no rule saying that two or more NFTs can\u2019t exist for the same file \u2014 you can have NFTs with editions, kind of like trading cards. For example, an NFT can be rare because there are only 10 copies or common because thousands of the same NFT have been \u201cminted,\u201d or written to the blockchain. There\u2019s also nothing to stop someone from taking the file you\u2019ve used for your NFT and creating their own NFT with it (though the blockchain entry will show that it came from their account, not yours).\nYou can technically sell any digital file as an NFT, but if you\u2019re looking to use a marketplace\u2019s easy minting tools, you\u2019re going to be limited to the formats they support. We\u2019ll touch on that a bit more later, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that your first NFT should probably be an image, video, or audio clip of some sort. If you don\u2019t know what you want to sell as an NFT yet, those kinds of restrictions could help you narrow down the possibilities. With that said...\nStep 2: Make sure you actually want to sell an NFT\nIf you just have the vague idea that you want to make an NFT because seemingly everyone is doing it, there are a few considerations you may want to take into account. The first big one is transaction fees. While the platforms that we\u2019ll cover today will let you create NFTs for free, selling them could be a different matter. \nYou can end up sinking a lot of money into the business before selling a single NFT\nMost NFTs are sold on the Ethereum blockchain (we\u2019ll touch on ones that aren\u2019t in the next section), and every transaction on the Ethereum blockchains costs fees that are paid to the miners. These fees \nare called \u201cgas,\u201d\n and the amount of gas you need for a transaction (and therefore how much that transaction will cost) can vary significantly. Almost everything you do on the blockchain, from minting an NFT to transferring it to someone else to bidding to purchase one, will cost gas (though there are some ways around this for creating NFTs, which we\u2019ll go over in a moment).\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that paying gas \ndoes not 100 percent guarantee your transfer will go through\n. You can pay more to give yourself a higher chance, but it is never a sure thing. To be clear, most transactions \nare\n likely to go through. However, if something does happen and your transaction isn\u2019t completed, you \nwon\u2019t get the gas fees you paid back\n.\nThen there\u2019s the environmental aspect of NFTs. The most popular (and easiest to use) NFT marketplaces mostly run on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses an energy-intensive \u201cproof of work\u201d system (you can read \nmore about what that means here\n). While there\u2019s debate on whether individually selling NFTs \nhas an effect on the overall energy use of the blockchain\n, if your NFTs are built on Ethereum, you are making use of a system that has a big carbon footprint.\nThere are blockchains that use alternate systems that don\u2019t use as much energy, and Ethereum has plans to move to a more efficient proof of stake system at some point in the future. However, that\u2019s not the case yet, which is one of the reasons people might get upset when others decide to sell NFTs.\nStep 3: Choose a platform to sell your NFT on\nThere are dozens of platforms that let you sell NFTs across a wide variety of blockchains, so it\u2019s almost impossible for any single guide to cover them all, much less tell you which one is the right one for your project. We\u2019ll be covering two of the more popular marketplaces in this guide, but do know that there are alternatives if neither of these platforms fit what you want to do, like \nAtomicHub\n, which uses the Wax blockchain, or the \nSolana-based Solsea\n. \nIt\u2019s also worth noting at this point that our guide will show you how to do things the basic way. Even with NFT markets, there are deep rabbit holes you can go down that won\u2019t be covered in this guide (things like selling an NFT minted with \nOpenSea\n on Rarible, programmatically generating collections like Bored Apes, and so on). Just know that this isn\u2019t meant to be a comprehensive compendium on selling NFTs \u2014 it\u2019s just getting you to the path.\nBoth OpenSea and Rarible let you create NFTs on Ethereum without paying anything, thanks to what they call \n\u201clazy minting\u201d systems\n. Lazy minting lets you create an NFT and put it up for sale without it actually being written to the blockchain, thus avoiding any fees. When someone actually buys it, the fees for writing your NFT to the blockchain will be bundled with the fees to transfer it to the buyer. That helps you avoid the situation where you pay $10 to $30 (or more!) to mint an NFT that no one ends up buying.\nWhen it comes to minting NFTs, most options have some sort of trade-off\nThere can be catches \u2014 with OpenSea, listing your first Ethereum NFT for sale \nwill require initializing your account\n, which will cost money (during testing in June 2022, I saw prices around the $60-70 mark). It is a one-time fee, and after paying it, you\u2019ll be able to lazy mint NFTs without having to pay anything. \nWith Rarible, I didn\u2019t have to pay this sort of fee during my testing. However, trying to remove your NFT from sale will cost a fee (I saw prices around $6-8). Both Rarible and OpenSea will take a 2.5 percent fee from any sales you make \u2014 if you sell an NFT for 0.025 ETH, you\u2019ll actually receive 0.024375 ETH.\nThere are, however, alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain. Rarible \nlets you sell NFTs using the Flow blockchain\n (the same one used by NBA Top Shot) if you sign up for it using the Blocto wallet, and both it and OpenSea will \nlet you sell using the Polygon blockchain\n. Both options have much lower fees than those you pay for using the Ethereum blockchain, if any fees at all, so we will at least touch on using them.\nHeads up! The Polygon blockchain has nothing to do with \nVox Media\u2019s gaming-focused outlet \nPolygon\nAs you might have guessed, if there were no catches or downsides to these low / no-fee blockchains, everyone would be using them. At the time of writing, choosing to use Flow on Rarible will limit you to single edition NFTs (one of ones), and you won\u2019t be able to sell them with an auction. Additionally, when you\u2019re using non-Ethereum blockchains like Flow or Polygon, people \ncan\u2019t use Ethereum to purchase your NFTs\n (at least, not without going through extra, fee-inducing steps). While both platforms do let buyers add funds to their wallet to complete a purchase, having to convert or outright buy another cryptocurrency to nab your NFT may put some collectors off.\n(Note: while Polygon does let you use Ethereum, it\u2019s actually Polygon\u2019s version of Ethereum. You can directly transfer Ethereum from its main blockchain over to Polygon and transfer back, but doing so will incur gas fees.)\nDo I have to use a marketplace site to create an NFT?\nTechnically, no. You can \ncreate your own smart contract\n, deploy it to the blockchain of your choice, and then mint your own tokens using it. That\u2019s jumping into the deep end, though, and probably not the route you\u2019ll want to go unless you\u2019re very technical. Most people will want to use one of the platforms discussed above.\nStep 4: Set up a wallet\nWallets are the applications you use to store your cryptocurrencies, as well as any NFTs you end up minting or buying. Coinbase has \na more in-depth explanation\n of how wallets work and the different options that are available, but if you\u2019re just getting started, there\u2019s really one main thing you need to worry about: using a wallet that\u2019s compatible with the blockchain you\u2019re using. \nMetaMask\u2019s wallet is one of the wallets that\u2019s widely supported by Ethereum-based applications like OpenSea, Foundation, and others and can be used either as a \nChrome\n / \nFirefox\n extension or as an \niOS\n / \nAndroid\n app. Coinbase also has its own wallet that you can use as an extension or an app, and it\u2019s supported by most platforms. You may want to consider Coinbase\u2019s wallet if you\u2019re planning on getting into crypto more broadly, as it has support for blockchains not based on Ethereum, like Bitcoin.\nMetaMask and Coinbase Wallet\u2019s setup processes are similar. Once you have the browser extension or app installed (MetaMask can be \ndownloaded here\n, Coinbase Wallet \nhere\n), click or tap the \u201cCreate new wallet\u201d button. Coinbase will ask you for a username, and both will ask you for a password, which you\u2019ll want to make sure is secure (preferably by generating it with and \nsaving it in a password manager\n). \nKeep your seed phrase as secure as you possibly can \u2014 both from prying eyes and the possibility of loss. Do not post it, even a blurred version of it, on the internet (as I am doing).\nFinally, both MetaMask and Coinbase will give you what\u2019s known as a \u201cseed phrase,\u201d which is 12 random words. It\u2019s \nvery\n important not to lose this, as it will let you recover your account if you, say, uninstall the app or need to set up your wallet on a new device. It\u2019s a good idea to copy it and store it in a very safe location, such as a physical safe or password manager (or both). MetaMask will ask you to repeat the phrase back, while Coinbase Wallet will ask you if you want to store an encrypted copy of it on the cloud if you set it up using the app. If you\u2019re setting Coinbase up with the extension or you choose to manually back it up instead of saving it to the cloud, it\u2019ll be the same process as MetaMask, where you\u2019ll have to re-enter the phrase manually.\nIf you lose your password and / or security phrase, you\u2019ll be out of luck with both MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet \u2014 neither company can do anything to help you. That means you\u2019ll lose access to any cryptocurrency or NFTs stored in that wallet, as well as the accounts that you\u2019ve set up using it. So seriously, \nkeep your password and secret phrase safe\n.\nFinally, you\u2019ll have access to your wallet, which won\u2019t have anything in it yet!\nStep 5: Connect your wallet\nAfter you\u2019ve got your wallet set up, you\u2019ll want to connect it with the NFT marketplace you plan on using. OpenSea and Rarible make this easy \u2014 clicking the Create button in the top left prompts you to connect your wallet. You\u2019ll then be presented with a list of compatible wallets, and choosing yours will prompt you to go through the connection process. \nConnecting an account with MetaMask is simple if you have the browser extension installed.\nIf you have Metamask or Coinbase\u2019s extension installed, you\u2019ll see a pop-up asking you if you want to connect your wallet, which can be done with a few button clicks. If you\u2019re using the Coinbase Wallet app, you can also connect to the marketplace by using the QR code scanner (which you can find to the right of your balance on the main wallet screen).\nThe QR button in the Coinbase Wallet app lets you scan a QR code to connect to NFT marketplaces or other apps that require a wallet.\nA word of caution for the future: be careful if you see a request to connect to your wallet when you don\u2019t expect it, as \nscammers could be trying to access your funds or NFTs\n. As long as you\u2019re on a trusted site, you should generally be okay (at least, as long as something \nisn\u2019t very wrong\n \u2014 be sure to check transactions to make sure they\u2019re kosher). But if an unknown site asks to connect to your wallet, you should probably think twice before accepting.\nStep 6: Create an NFT\nAfter you\u2019ve connected your wallet, you\u2019ll arrive at the page you use to create an NFT (and if you don\u2019t end up there, you can get there by clicking the Create button that both platforms put in the upper right-hand corner). \nBefore we start creating our NFTs, a word on collections \u2014 both platforms support collections, which are pretty much what they sound like. If you want to create a series of NFTs, you can use a collection to do so \u2014 on Rarible, you can create one right from the NFT creation screen, which the NFT you\u2019re making will be added to. On OpenSea, you\u2019ll have to go to your profile picture in the top right, then go to My Collections > Create a collection. \nWe won\u2019t cover collections in this guide, but OpenSea will automatically place the NFT you create into an unnamed collection if you don\u2019t specify one (you can either edit the collection later or move the NFT to another collection), and Rarible lets you sell an NFT as a Rarible Single without a collection.  \nNow, let\u2019s finally get started on our NFT.\nListing an NFT on OpenSea\nAfter clicking the Create button, you\u2019ll be brought to the create new item page. To start, click the box with an image icon in it, which will let you upload the file you\u2019ll be selling as an NFT (though, do make sure to take note of the file size and type limitations noted above the selector). \nAfter you\u2019ve added your file, give it a name, or title. You can also use the External Link field to add a URL pointing to, say, your website or Twitter account, and you can use the Description field to give potential buyers a better idea of what your NFT is.\nSome file types, like videos or music, will ask for a second \u201cpreview\u201d image.\nUnderneath those fields, you can choose a collection for your NFT if you\u2019ve set one up, as well as add properties, levels, or stats that can basically act as metadata. If you\u2019re selling an NFT that could act as a video game character, for instance, this is where you\u2019d put in their information. If you\u2019re selling a piece of art, you could use the properties panel to add information about it, such as the medium, year, etc. However, all these fields are optional, so a lot of people will probably be able to ignore them. \nOpenSea also lets you add text that acts as unlockable content, which the buyer / owner of the NFT will be able to see. You could use this toggle-able field to include something like an invite link to a private Discord, a code to redeem something on an external website, or even just a message thanking them for buying. You can also use the explicit and sensitive content toggle if your NFT is NSFW in nature.\nBe sure to pay close attention to which blockchain you\u2019re minting on \u2014 you can\u2019t change it later, and it could have a drastic effect on the fees you pay.\nAfter those toggles and fields is the dropdown you use to select which blockchain you\u2019re minting your NFT to \u2014 the Ethereum chain or the Polygon one. You can see Step 3 for more information on the pros and cons of each, but we\u2019re going to go with Polygon for our example, as it \ncurrently doesn\u2019t require paying any fees\n. If you\u2019re minting with Polygon, you\u2019ll also have the option to mint multiple copies of your NFT. \nAfter you\u2019ve chosen your blockchain, you\u2019ll want to double-check everything. OpenSea lets you change the metadata afterward as long as you haven\u2019t put it up for sale, but it\u2019s good practice to make sure everything\u2019s shipshape before doing anything blockchain-related. And note that you \nwon\u2019t\n be able to change which blockchain the NFT is on after the fact.\nAfter you\u2019re good to go, you can click the Create button. Depending on the options you\u2019ve selected and what kind of file you\u2019re selling as an NFT, there might be a bit of a wait as things upload. After it finishes, you\u2019ll see a screen saying that your NFT was created.\nOur NFT is on OpenSea but not written to the blockchain yet \u2014 that won\u2019t happen until someone purchases it.\nHowever, your NFT isn\u2019t actually up for sale on OpenSea yet \u2014 to do that, you\u2019ll have to click off of the congratulations screen to get to your NFT\u2019s page (you can also get to it by clicking on your profile picture, clicking on the Created tab, and selecting the NFT). On the NFT\u2019s page, there\u2019ll be a Sell button. \nThis NFT has been created, but isn\u2019t for sale \u2014 to list it, click the Sell button.\nWith NFTs listed on Ethereum or Polygon, you\u2019ll have the option to create a listing for a fixed price, and on Ethereum, you\u2019ll have the option to create a timed auction as well. For a fixed price listing, you\u2019ll simply put in the amount that you want to sell the item for (listed in Ethereum, but it\u2019ll give you an approximate dollar amount below) and choose how long you want the listing to be available for. \nOpenSea\u2019s Polygon implementation only supports fixed-price sales at time of writing.\nSince the NFT will be available to purchase as soon as you list it, you can also make it only available to a specific buyer using the \u201cMore options\u201d dropdown.\nTo list your NFT for sale, click the \u201cComplete listing\u201d button. You\u2019ll have to confirm, or sign, a few transactions with your wallet, either using the browser extension or the app. On Polygon, the transactions are free, and you\u2019ll get a screen saying that your item\u2019s been listed.\nAn example signature request in the Coinbase Wallet app.\nOn Ethereum, you\u2019ll have to do a one-time approval transaction to \u201cinitialize\u201d your wallet if it\u2019s your first NFT, which we discussed above. To do so, you\u2019ll need to have Ethereum in your wallet. Buying crypto could be its own separate explainer, but \nhere\u2019s a guide to get you started\n. \nThe money for this transaction is only going towards gas, not a fee for OpenSea, so how much it costs depends entirely on how much Ethereum\u2019s gas fees are at the moment. In my original tests in December 2021, I saw prices from around $240 to $450, but in June 2022 those prices had dropped to $50 to $60. It basically all depends on the price of Ethereum and how many people are trying to carry out transactions, so if the fees seem high you may want to wait until the price drops \u2014 you can use \na site like ETH Gas Station\n to monitor transaction costs, or watch out for a high fee warning in MetaMask.\nRegistering to use Ethereum with OpenSea can be expensive.\nAfter you\u2019ve approved and signed all the transactions, your NFT will be listed for sale on OpenSea.\nListing an NFT on Rarible\nThe first question Rarible will ask is which blockchain you want to mint your NFT to, offering you the options of Ethereum, Flow, Tezos, or Polygon. Unlike OpenSea, the site doesn\u2019t cover Polygon fees, so you\u2019ll have to pay to mint or sell an NFT if you\u2019re using that blockchain. For this example, we\u2019ll be using Ethereum.\nRarible starts you with an option right off the bat.\nAfter choosing a blockchain, you\u2019ll have to decide whether you want to create a single-edition NFT or a multiple-edition NFT \u2014 in other words, whether you want to create a one-of-one NFT, or one that\u2019s limited edition but can be purchased by multiple people. The screens you\u2019ll end up on are largely similar (though you can only use Ethereum if you\u2019re creating a multiple-edition, and you\u2019ll have to specify the number of copies you want to sell), but for this example, we\u2019ll choose single. \nAfter choosing single on Rarible, you\u2019ll end up on the NFT creation screen. The first thing to do is upload the digital file you\u2019re hoping to sell as an NFT, using the Choose File button. Eventually, it\u2019ll end up on \nthe InterPlanetary File System\n, or IPFS, which is a decentralized way to store media, making it so that your NFT won\u2019t disappear off the internet if one company decides to stop hosting it.\nLike OpenSea, Rarible may ask you for a separate preview image for certain types of media, like videos or music \u2014 think of this as a video thumbnail or album art, which will display whenever your NFT shows up on the site. \nRarible gives you a few options for how you\u2019ll sell your NFT.\nNext, you\u2019ll want to set your selling options. If you don\u2019t want to sell your NFT just yet, you can flip off the \u201cPut on marketplace\u201d switch, which is on by default. If you do want to sell your NFT, though, you\u2019ll have options.\n\u201cFixed price\u201d is like creating a store listing \u2014 you set a price for your NFT, and if someone wants to pay that price, they can just buy it.\n\u201cOpen for bids\u201d lets people submit offers to buy your NFT, which you can either accept or reject.\n\u201cTimed auction\u201d is an auction \u2014 you can set a minimum price and choose when the auction will start and how long it will last. \nFor this example, we\u2019ll go with listing our NFT for a fixed price, which we can enter into the field. You can also choose which currency you\u2019d like to receive (people can, however, send offers in different currencies). When you\u2019re setting your price, remember that Rarible will take 2.5 percent if your NFT sells.\nAfter you choose your selling method and details, you\u2019ll have the option to add unlockable content, which will be provided to the buyer. This could be something like an invite link to a private Discord, a code to redeem something on an external website, or even just a message thanking them for buying. \nThe next two options let you use choose your collection (we\u2019ll go with Rarible Singles for our example), and the Free Minting option, which lets you choose whether you want to use Rarible\u2019s lazy minting system, which we went over in Step 3. If you turn it off and are using the Ethereum blockchain, you\u2019ll have to pay a gas fee to mint your NFT at the end of this process \u2014 when I was testing, the fee was around $20.\nName and description will be important to help you stand out. Most people will want to leave the free minting option on.\nYou then give your NFT a name \u2014 or title \u2014 and a description if you want. Finally, you can choose the royalty percentage. This will change how much of each subsequent sale goes back to you in the future. For example, if someone purchases your NFT for 0.2 ETH and then sells it for 1 ETH in the future, you\u2019ll get a percentage of that sale as well \u2014 by default, it\u2019s 10 percent (so 0.1 ETH in our example).\nThe last option is the Advanced Settings, which lets you add properties to your NFT (which is completely optional but could be useful if you were creating a series of characters with different properties) and alternative description text, which will help make your NFT more accessible. \nDouble-check that everything is exactly how you want it, as it could be expensive or impossible to change later. Then, when you\u2019re sure your NFT is good to go, click the \u201cCreate Item\u201d button.\nYour wallet, in this case MetaMask, will ask you to sign a few transactions. \nDoing this will kick off a series of actions, during which you\u2019ll have to approve some transactions with your wallet. If you\u2019re using a browser extension, you should get a pop-up when Rarible asks for your signature (if not, you can click on the extension\u2019s icon in your browser, and it should present you with any requests). If you\u2019re using an app, you\u2019ll want to open it on your phone, where you\u2019ll be presented with the request.\nYour NFT has been created!\nAfter approving a few wallet requests and a moment of waiting, you\u2019ll get a message saying that your NFT has been created. You can click the \u201cView NFT\u201d button to see it, and you can see your collection by going to your profile picture in the top right and clicking \u201cMy Profile.\u201d\nHey, I made an NFT, but it hasn\u2019t shown up in my wallet\nThere\u2019s no need to worry if your wallet has an NFT section and the NFT you made using this guide doesn\u2019t show up in it. Your wallet reads entries from the blockchain to figure out what it should display, and lazy minted NFTs aren\u2019t actually written to the blockchain until someone buys them \u2014 thus, they won\u2019t show up in your wallet immediately after you create them.\u00a0\nThe hard sell\nIf everything\u2019s gone well, you\u2019ll now have an NFT listed for sale on either Rarible, OpenSea, or both. However, as sellers have told me, that\u2019s not likely to get you very far \u2014 as you\u2019ve seen, the process is relatively complicated, but the gold rush-esque environment around NFTs has led many to try their hand at making one. If you want your creation to actually sell, you\u2019ll likely have to find some way to rise above the noise, either through snazzy marketing or making your art absolutely exceptional (and then probably doing some snazzy marketing). That task, however, I\u2019ll leave in your hands.\nRelated:"
