        "original_content": "Though \ncryptocurrency\n can be an attractive investment, it\u2019s more susceptible to scams than any other payment method. Over $1 billion has been reported stolen through crypto scams between January 2021 and June 2022, according to a report by the Federal Trade Commission.\nCrypto scams are a type of investment fraud that can take many forms, from phishing scams to \nrug pulls\n. Since crypto\u2019s \nblockchain technology\n isn\u2019t regulated by a central authority like a bank, bad actors can easily take advantage of hopeful investors.\nCrypto transactions are also pseudonymous (users interact through coded addresses, not legal names) and irreversible, so it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to recover any money lost to a scammer. Here are the most common crypto scams, how to avoid them, and what to do if you\u2019ve been scammed.\nWhy is crypto prone to scams?\nCryptocurrency is especially attractive to scammers for three main reasons: a lack of centralized authority, irreversible transactions and the ability to be almost anonymous.\nDecentralized:\n Since crypto assets and applications are part of a \ndecentralized financial (DeFi)\n system, intended to be used without oversight from a bank or government, there\u2019s no central authority to stop a transaction or flag something if it looks suspicious.\nIrreversible:\n Because of the way the blockchain works, once you\u2019ve sent a crypto transaction, there\u2019s no way to retrieve your funds.\nPseudonymous:\n Crypto users interact through wallet addresses, not legal names, so it\u2019s difficult to track down specific users, especially if they\u2019re trying to stay hidden.\nThough crypto can be more prone to scams than other assets, \u201ca lot of the scams that take place were happening before crypto existed,\u201d says Sol Nasisi, founder of cryptocurrency gifting service GiftaBit.\n\u201cWith crypto, both the risks and rewards are supercharged,\u201d Nasisi says. \u201cAnd as with any new technology, there will be bad actors that exploit it.\u201d\nWhat are the different types of cryptocurrency scams?\nThere are many different scam techniques in the crypto space. Here are some of the most common:\nExit scams\nExit scams happen when developers of new crypto projects defraud investors by promising big returns, but pocket the funds or abandon the projects before investors can profit.\nInitial coin offering (or ICO) scams,\n also known as \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes, happen when developers promise their new coin or crypto platform will generate huge returns, then disappear with investors' funds by selling off all of the tokens at once.\nRug pulls\n,\n which get their name from the expression \u201cpulling the rug out,\u201d involve a developer attracting investors to a new cryptocurrency project, usually in DeFi, then pulling out before the project is built, leaving investors with worthless currency. These scams can sometimes include a version of a Ponzi scheme, where investors profit by recruiting other users with false financial promises.\nCelebrity endorsements\n often fit into this category, too: Developers will pay famous actors or internet personalities to promote a coin or platform to attract investors, then pull the rug out. These can also be phishing scams when scammers use fake images, videos or websites to claim that public figures have endorsed their scheme.\nPhishing scams\nPhishing scams are nothing new, but transactions are harder to trace and reverse with crypto. These can look like employment offers or requests for help, usually via random contact by email, phone or social media.\nOffers and requests might link to a professional-looking website or detail an \u201cunmissable\u201d investment opportunity. Scammers may ask for a direct crypto transfer and stop communicating once payment is received, while others might request you share the private keys used to secure your crypto wallet so they can access your account and empty it.\nScammers may also attempt to create fake versions of popular crypto exchanges or online wallets under similar domain names to get investors to log in with their credentials.\nAdvertisement\nNerdWallet rating\u00a0\nNerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Using common-sense measures and proven security protections can go a long way. Here are a few helpful methods:\nProtect your wallet:\n You need some form of storage, like a wallet, to keep your crypto safe. If a firm asks you to share your private keys to take part in an investment opportunity, it\u2019s almost certainly a scam. Using security backup methods like a \nseed phrase\n, a set of code words that can unlock your wallet like a master password, can provide additional protection.\nIgnore cold calls:\n If you\u2019re contacted out of the blue about a cryptocurrency investment opportunity, it\u2019s likely to be a scam. Never give away your personal information or transfer money to someone you don\u2019t know.\nAsk yourself if it\u2019s too good to be true:\n Cryptocurrency scams often promise to make high returns from your initial investment that are too good to be true. Any company offering get-rich-quick investment opportunities is likely to be fraudulent.\nCrypto is a high-risk investment, and no asset can reliably guarantee high returns.\nTake your time:\n If a company tries to pressure you into investing quickly, it\u2019s likely to be fraudulent. Some scammers even offer bonuses or discounts to persuade you to invest right away. Take your time and do your research before investing any money.\nAvoid social media hype:\n Scammers often use social media to advertise fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Some also use images of celebrities \u2014 often without their consent \u2014 and high-profile people to \u201cendorse\u201d their company and make their investment seem legitimate.\nRead the white paper:\n Developers release documents called white papers that explain the technology they\u2019re working on and the purpose of the coin or project. These are generally published online and easily accessible.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know anything about the backers, or if the project doesn\u2019t solve any kind of need, it\u2019s not a good idea to invest,\u201d Nasisi says.\nWhat to do if you have been scammed\nFalling victim to a cryptocurrency scam can be devastating, but it\u2019s important to act quickly if you\u2019ve made a payment or shared personal details. You need to contact your bank as soon as possible if you have:\nMade a payment using a debit or credit card.\nMade a payment via bank transfer.\nShared personal information.\nScammers often retarget victims of cryptocurrency scams or sell their details. Make sure to change your security details and passwords, especially for online banking, if you think you\u2019ve been caught in a scam.\nHow to report scammers\nWhether you\u2019ve fallen for a cryptocurrency scam or just seen one online, it\u2019s important to report them, as it helps officials investigate fraudulent companies and stop them from targeting other people.\nSome scams fall outside U.S. jurisdiction, so law enforcement may not be able to enforce consequences, but it\u2019s still helpful to report them.
