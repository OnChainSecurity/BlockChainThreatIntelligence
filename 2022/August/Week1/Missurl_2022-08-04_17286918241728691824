One such trend is \nMaximal Extractable Value (MEV)\n, which denotes the ability of block producers in a blockchain network to extract profits from users through the inclusion, exclusion, or rearrangement of transactions in blocks.\u00a0\nThis article will explain the present-day dynamics of MEV, its effects on users and Ethereum, and what is next for MEV and \nMEV-Boost\n in a post-merge Ethereum environment.\nMaximal Extractable Value (MEV) concerns the (potential) profits that accrue to entities producing blocks on a blockchain network based on their capacity to include, censor, or re-order transactions within blocks.\nThe concept of MEV\u2013especially in the context of smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum\u2013first appeared in \nFlashboys 2.0\n, a 2019 research study by \nAri Juels et al\n. The researchers showed how MEV dynamics played out in real-time and detailed its effects on users and the blockchain itself. Since then, the MEV space has grown into a million-dollar industry, forcing blockchain researchers to increase efforts aimed at responding effectively to this trend.\u00a0\n\u201cMiner Extracted Value\u201d was the original term used to describe this concept, but was deprecated partly because of Ethereum\u2019s switch to Proof-of-Stake, where validators staking coins\u2013not miners solving proof-of-work problems\u2013produce blocks.\u00a0\nMEV is a by-product of designs adopted in many blockchains in which miners/validators are responsible for building a block \nand\n proposing it for addition to the chain. To build new blocks, nodes collect transactions stored in the \nmempool\n, which is a location where transactions are stored pending addition to the chain.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the blockchain doesn\u2019t enforce rules on the contents (i.e. transactions) of a block or the ordering of transactions in the block. The block producer is free to arbitrarily include, exclude, or reorder transactions however they want. As rational economic actors, block producers will often include, exclude, and re-order transactions based on the transaction fee the sender is willing to pay\u2013which is how MEV became a multi-million dollar industry.\nBlock producers and other actors in the blockchain network leverage various systematic inefficiencies and opportunities to make profit.\nOften these MEV\u00a0profits come at the expense of the ordinary user whose transactions must go through the public mempool before they can be executed. In the public mempool, two things can happen:\nThe block producer can refuse to process the transaction, so the trader loses the opportunity. They can also decide to capture the opportunity for themselves by copying details of the transaction and creating a similar transaction and including it in a block.\u00a0\nAnother trader (or trader bot) watching the mempool can copy the transaction details and send a similar transaction to the mempool with a \nhigher \ngas price, so the block producer executes their trade first. The original sender may increase their transaction fee in response, starting a bidding war of sorts (formally known as a Priority Gas Auction).\nSay the arbitrage opportunity described above is worth $1,000 in pure profits (i.e. the total MEV that can be extracted by the block producer. That\u2019s because the block producer ultimately decides the inclusion and position of the transaction in a block. If the block producer decides not to capture the opportunity, the trader\u2019s profit is the difference between the total MEV available and the fee paid to the block producer for processing the transaction.\u00a0\nMEV causes multiple problems including attacking traders, increasing network-wide transaction fees, overloading the network, and \u00a0may have negative implications for blockchain security. \nLet's explore each one.\nFrontrunning is when an entity copies a transaction from the mempool and bribes the block producer with a higher gas fee to get their transaction included ahead of the original transaction. Or, in the worst case, the block producer captures the trade opportunity and censors the initial transaction.\u00a0\nFrontrunning causes \u201cslippage\u201d (i.e. the difference between the expected amount of tokens and the amount received). For instance, trader A conducts a swap or buy order after analyzing current token prices, but trader B frontruns the transaction and triggers a price change before trader A\u2019s transaction can execute.\u00a0\nThis will either reduce the tokens trader A will receive or cause the trade to fail\u2013if their funds cannot buy the desired amount of tokens at the now-changed price. Not only does this create a bad user experience for traders, but it negates the goal of DeFi to accrue value equitably to all users.\u00a0\nAnother effect of MEV-related transactions is the pressure they put on network-wide transaction fees. Because MEV opportunities are very lucrative, traders and bots are incentivized to express a preference for the inclusion of transactions in blocks by paying high gas prices. The increase in gas prices also affects regular users who have to match arbitrageurs or risk having their transactions delayed.\u00a0\nMoreover, priority gas auctions (PGAs) involve traders/trading bots sending the same transaction multiple times, increasing the number of transactions gossiped through the peer-to-peer network. This affects node runners since they must invest in higher bandwidth to keep up with the message overhead.\u00a0\nIf miners or validators start censoring transactions and capturing MEV opportunities, the decentralization of public blockchains could be threatened. MEV can also encourage the proliferation of \u201c\ndark pools\n\u201d which are permissioned mempools operated by block producers who share MEV profits directly with traders. Dark pools could destroy the permissionless nature of Ethereum and lead to centralization.\u00a0\nBut, more importantly, MEV has implications for the security of blockchains.\nAn MEV-related security concern outlined in the Flashboys 2.0 paper is \u201ctime-bandit attacks\u201d targeted at capturing MEV profits. Below is an illustration of this type of attack would work. We refer to block producers as miners for simplicity, but they could also be validators.\nBob and Charlie are two miners in Ethereum.\nBob mines block A which contains a transaction worth $5,000 in MEV profits and mines block B afterward.\u00a0\nInstead of building on Bob\u2019s block, Charlie secretly re-mines block A and inserts a transaction capturing the MEV for himself.\nCharlie also re-mines block B and mines an additional block C so that his chain is longer than Bob\u2019s.\u00a0\nCharlie broadcasts the newly produced block to the rest of the network,\n causing a chain reorganization\n.\nPoW blockchains follow the \u201clongest chain rule\u201d, (i.e. the chain with more blocks is considered the valid chain)\nCharlie\u2019s chain now replaces Bob\u2019s chain\nBob\u2019s earlier blocks simply \u201cdisappear\u201d\nNot only do time-bandit attacks threaten the notion of \nfinality\n in blockchains, but they could lead to a breakdown in consensus. With multiple miners triggering chain reorgs, it\u2019d be difficult for other nodes to detect the correct chain\u2013as shown in the example, the \u201cheaviest chain\u201d rule isn\u2019t always sufficient to determine a chain\u2019s validity.\u00a0\nWhile MEV has negative connotations, it isn\u2019t always harmful. For example, arbitrage traders ensure that users get the best prices for assets\u2013especially on decentralized exchanges\u2013whilst making profits themselves.\u00a0\nIf a token is underpriced on a DEX, a large sell order will reduce its listed price; and if the token is overpriced, a large sell order will decrease its valuation. Without traders spotting price disparities across decentralized exchanges, the DeFi marketplace would lack efficiency.\u00a0\nMEV-Boost\n is a solution created by the Flashbots team to help mitigate the centralizing forces of MEV designed in preparation for Ethereum\u2019s switch to Proof-of-Stake consensus (i.e. \nThe Merge\n).\nResearchers hope that MEV-Boost and, in the future, \nProposer-Builder Separation\n and \ndanksharding\n will help to mitigate MEV\u2019s real threats to a permissionless and decentralized Ethereum and will continue to further help reduce gas fees and network congestion for users."
