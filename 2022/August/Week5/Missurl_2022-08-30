For the third time in August, hackers gained control of the Ethereum Classic blockchain in a 51% attack that reorganized over 7,000 blocks. \n\nThough Ethereum Classic developers are rushing to protect the blockchain from future attacks, these three attacks raise concerns over the network\u2019s security. OKEx, for instance, has considered delisting the coin to protect itself from future losses.\n\nWhat is a 51% attack?  \n\nHackers conduct a 51% attack to take over the blockchain. Blockchains are so-called decentralized ledgers because they distribute all the work of validating transactions across a global network of computers, called miners.\n\n\nEach transaction must be approved by over 51% of miners. So the theory goes, it\u2019s very difficult for a single actor to control 51% of the network, since that would require an immense amount of computational power.\n\nBut if someone managed to control the network, they\u2019d be able to bend the blockchain to their will-credit their accounts with free cryptocurrency, for instance, or divert other people\u2019s transactions to their own people\u2019s wallets. \n\nImpossible! They\u2019ll never do it! Not so for Ethereum Classic-the un-forked version of the more popular Ethereum blockchain-which this month was thrice exploited by hackers. \n\nSo what happened? \n\nThe latest attack took place last night. Hackers managed to once again brute-force their way to majority control over the network and managed to reorganise more than 7,000 blocks, or about two days of mining.\n\nThe attack was identified by Austrian mining company Bitfly, which also identified the first and second attacks, wherein hackers reorganised almost 8,000 blocks and took home around $9m in double spend transactions, much of it from crypto exchange OKEx. \n\nAD\n\n\nETC Cooperative, the non-profit that watches over the Ethereum Classic blockchain, said in a tweet late last night that it is \"aware of today's attack and are working with others to test and evaluate proposed solutions as quickly as possible.\"\n\nNot much is known about the latest attack. \n\nOne of the reasons it occurred was that there\u2019s far less computational power backing Ethereum Classic than on larger blockchains, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, meaning it\u2019s not so difficult to briefly rent enough computational power to gain majority control over the blockchain. \n\nCoinbase is one of the largest crypto exchanges.

The industry-leading digital asset custody and exchange platform yesterday released a post-mortem on the Ethereum Classic double-spend attacks that took place in early August, in which they calculated that approximately $9 million in assets were stolen from crypto exchanges. Coinbase confirmed it was not the target of any of the malicious transactions, and no customer funds were affected....\n\nNews\nBusiness\n3 min read\nAlexander Behrens\nAug 22, 2020\nThere are two drafts to change Ethereum Classic\u2019s algorithm to make this more difficult, but they\u2019ve not yet been implemented.\n\nSince the hack, Ethereum Classic\u2019s token price has fallen by 1.68%, per data metrics site CoinMarketCap. But the long-term damage may be greater. The coin\u2019s listed as suffering from \"degraded performance\" on Coinbase, for instance.\n\nAnd after the previous two attacks earlier this month, OKEx said that it would \"consider delisting ETC, pending the results of the Ethereum Classic community\u2019s work to improve the security of its chain.\" This is because OKEx bore the brunt of the first attacks, and \"suffered a loss of approximately $5.6 million in ETC,\" according to a statement of August 15. \n\n\"The loss was fully borne by OKEx, according to its user-protection policy, and did not cause any loss to the platform\u2019s users. The ETC that users have deposited on OKEx remains safe,\" it said after the previous attack. \n\nAD\n\nEthereum Classic developers must plug the exploit before OKEx makes its move. "
