        "original_content": "Smart contracts are extremely flexible, and capable of controlling large amounts of value and data, while running immutable logic based on code deployed on the blockchain. This has created a vibrant ecosystem of trustless and decentralized applications that provide many advantages over legacy systems. They also represent opportunities for attackers looking to profit by exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.\n\nPublic blockchains, like Ethereum, further complicate the issue of securing smart contracts. Deployed contract code usually cannot be changed to patch security flaws, while assets stolen from smart contracts are extremely difficult to track and mostly irrecoverable due to immutability.\n\nAlthough figures vary, it is estimated that the total amount of value stolen or lost due to security defects in smart contracts is easily over $1 billion. This includes high-profile incidents, such as the DAO hack(opens in a new tab) (3.6M ETH stolen, worth over $1B in today\u2019s prices), Parity multi-sig wallet hack(opens in a new tab) ($30M lost to hackers), and the Parity frozen wallet issue(opens in a new tab) (over $300M in ETH locked forever).\n\nThe aforementioned issues make it imperative for developers to invest effort in building secure, robust, and resilient smart contracts. Smart contract security is serious business, and one that every developer will do well to learn. This guide will cover security considerations for Ethereum developers and explore resources for improving smart contract security."
