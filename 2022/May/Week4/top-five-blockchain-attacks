To understand more about blockchain thefts, we have put together a list of the top five attacks and potential weaknesses to be aware of.\n\nOjasvi Nath Ojasvi Nath Assistant Editor, Spiceworks Ziff Davis\nMarch 28, 2022\n\ntop blockchain attacks and DLT vulnerabilities to know\nBlockchain is among the most secure technologies with data integrity, a decentralized system, and verifiability. However, new forms of security threats are emerging that are capable of causing enormous, irreparable damage. This article looks at the most common blockchain-related attacks that have challenged the technology\u2019s security credentials and the top ledger vulnerabilities that enabled such attacks.\n\nThrough cryptocurrency attacks, the cybercriminal community amassed $4.25 billion last year, nearly three times the $1.49 billion in crypto assets looted in 2020. According to statisticsOpens a new window  gathered by Comparitech, six of the top ten most expensive crypto breaches occurred in 2021. Another survey revealed that exploiting decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols was the fastest-growing way to steal crypto in 2021. DeFi is responsible for $1.4 billion of the overall crypto money lost alone in the previous year. The report stated that the technology is nascent, hence featuring many vulnerabilities that hackers routinely exploit.\n\nComparitech\nSource: Comparitech\n\n2022 also began with a massive breach in Crypto.com\u2019s infrastructure, indicating the emergence of a more complex pattern of crypto-attacks. The cryptocurrency exchange was plundered out of $30 million in crypto from 483 consumers\u2019 digital wallets in January. The attackers seized 4,836.26 ETH ($13 million) 443.93 BTC ($16 million), and $66,200 in other currencies. \n\nZebpay, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, faces a minimum of two DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks in a month. Malicious hackers routinely try to overwhelm the company\u2019s servers to interrupt services or scout for flaws in its network infrastructure. \n\nThese attempts and others suggest that it is high time for blockchain platforms to stop relying on their inherent security, begin implementing additional controls and safeguards and employ third-party auditors to assess their security. To understand the pattern of attacks and prevent future breaches, Toolbox has compiled a rundown of the top five hacks along with possible vulnerabilities to consider. \n\nSee More: Ukraine\u2019s IT Sector Ups the Ante, Why Blockchain Matters in HR & More in This Week\u2019s Top Reads\n\nTop Five Blockchain Attacks Wormhole\nWormhole, a cryptocurrency platform, was hacked in February 2022. The platform is a communication hub for Solana, an ethereum rival, and other self-driving financial networks. The corporation incurred a total loss of $326 million. According to reports, the problem was created by faulty account validation.\n\nOn Twitter, Wormhole also posted a chronology of the occurrence. The company fixed the vulnerability just six hours after the attack, and funds were returned early the next day. It also quickly restored the token key that hackers had knocked offline during the attack.\n\n\nBitMart\nHackers were able to compromise the encryption of two hot wallets linked to the BitMart crypto exchange thanks to a hacked private key - a component of the cryptographic pair that is intended to be kept as a secret.\n\nIn a tweet reporting the discovery of the loss, the group indicated that $100 million of the heist was on the Ethereum blockchain, which was targeted the most in big cyberattacks last year.\n\n\nFor a few days, the company terminated its transaction facilities until the time they declared a security improvement. Sheldon Xia, BitMart\u2019s CEO, assured its users of finding solutions and paying impacted consumers with corporate funds.\n\nPoly Network\nLast year in August, Poly Network was targeted by a hacker who exploited flaws in the platform\u2019s infrastructure and swindled more than $600 million in funds. The attacker approached the firm and offered to refund the bulk of the assets, except for $33 million in tether (USDT) that issuers had locked. But the saga didn\u2019t end there: $200 million of the stolen funds were locked away in an account that needed a key from both the hacker and Poly Network. \n\nThe hacker first refused to pass out credentials from their end. Until Poly Network pleaded with them to reveal it, gave them a $500,000 reward for discovering the system flaw, and even guaranteed them an employment opportunity. Poly Network later reported that the private key had been handed to them by some anonymous \"Mr. White Hat.\"\n\nMT Gox\nThe attack on MT Gox was the first significant exchange attack, and it remains the greatest Bitcoin exchange robbery to this day. The heist at MT Gox was not confined to a single incident. Instead, the site was losing money from 2011 till February 2014. Over a few years, hackers gained access to 100,000 bitcoins from the site and 750,000 bitcoins from its users. These bitcoins were valued at $470 million and are now worth approximately ten times more ($4.7 billion). MT Gox fell bankrupt shortly after the incident, with liquidators recovering about 200,000 of the stolen bitcoin.\n\nSee More: Why Blockchain Will Redefine the Internet of Things (IoT)\n\nLiquid Global\nUnauthorized users gained access to Liquid\u2019s wallets in August 2021 and transferred cash worth more than $97 million, according to the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. The hackers broke into Liquid\u2019s hot wallet and stole Ether, Bitcoins, XRP, and 66 other cryptocurrencies. Over 78% of the damage was due to Ethereum-based assets.\n\nA chunk of the hackers\u2019 plunder was transferred using leading-edge platforms like UniSwap, whereas the funds sent to other major cryptocurrency exchanges were withheld at the company\u2019s request. After transferring unaffected assets to cold wallets, the platform resumed trading and beefed its security by including secure vaults.\n\nAlso, the company assured its customers of \"no impact on user balances\" and later borrowed $120 million from the FTX crypto exchange to reimburse consumers and pay its losses."
