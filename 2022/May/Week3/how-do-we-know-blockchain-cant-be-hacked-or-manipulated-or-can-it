        "original_content": "How do we know blockchain can\u2019t be hacked or manipulated (or can it?)One of the reasons blockchain has become so popular is that its design prevents anyone from deleting or changing a record once it has been created. This makes it immensely useful for applications such as cryptocurrency - where it\u2019s important that records of spent money can\u2019t be changed or deleted - as well as e-voting, financial records, manufacturing records, product provenance, and many other applications.\n\nYet as businesses invest more and more in blockchain technology, it has piqued the interest of cybercriminals who have successfully attacked several blockchains - posing a significant threat that has researchers at the Monash Blockchain Technology Centre (MBTC) working hard on ways to increase the security of blockchain.\n\nBlockchain was designed to be secure. Conceptually, blockchain\u2019s design makes it impervious to compromise. Each block, or data record, is digitally signed with a \u2018hash\u2019 - the result of a mathematical algorithm - that is based on the contents of the record and every other record in the blockchain. If any of the records are subsequently changed, the computed hash will no longer match the original hash - and the change will be detected.\n\nIt\u2019s all about trust. Because it is designed as a distributed ledger, blockchain entries can be spread across numerous \u2018nodes\u2019, with several copies providing high redundancy to ensure the data is always available. To protect against false or changed records being inserted into the blockchain, the system uses ideas of trust that are built on consensus: if the majority of distributed nodes agree that a particular blockchain has a particular hash, then that hash is considered to be correct.\n\nBut trust is subjective. Cybercriminals recognised a long time ago that blockchain\u2019s algorithms are secure and sound, so they began looking for other ways to manipulate it. Last year, they found one - known as a \u201951 per cent attack\u2019 - that allowed them to push legitimate nodes out of the way and add so many nodes that they had 51 per cent of the active nodes. This let them take control of the hashing process, then generate blockchain hashes using a different version of the blockchain into which they had inserted different transactions. The net result: they could effectively delete a transaction record, over and over again - making it look like the Bitcoin had never been spent. This complex attack occurred nearly a dozen times during the middle of 2019, costing Bitcoin exchanges around $40m ($US28m) and exposing a potential challenge to the integrity of blockchains.\n\nThere is a better way. Such attacks are complex and rely on manipulating well-established consensus mechanisms. Yet as blockchain is moved into other sensitive and commercially-sensitive applications, similar attacks are sure to continue. Researchers like Dr Jiangshan Yu, Associate Director (Research) within the MBTC and a Lecturer in the Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity, is working to refine blockchain\u2019s trust structure with developments like RepuCoin - a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that is resistant to 51 per cent attacks while providing high transaction speeds of 10,000 transactions per second.\n\nAttacking blockchain helps make it more secure. RepuCoin is just one of several projects through which Dr Yu and his peers are testing the security and anonymity of real-world blockchains. Current research projects are exploring ways of directly attacking the technology, developing techniques to deanonymise supposedly anonymous transactions, and working on ways to scale blockchains to unprecedented heights.\n\nThere is, Yu says, a lot of room for improvement,\"Blockchain was considered, and is still considered, an immutable layer,\" he explains. \"But from all these existing attacks, we know there are problems - and that\u2019s what we are trying to address here at Monash.\"\n\n \n "
