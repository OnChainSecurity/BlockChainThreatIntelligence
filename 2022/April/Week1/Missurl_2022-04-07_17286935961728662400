        "original_content": "With the \nveBAL Activation Proposal\n being approved by the Balancer community, the new veBAL governance system is kicking off. As described in the original \nveBAL tokenomics proposal\n, the new architecture has many advantages such as:\nLong-term alignment:\n By locking BPT, token holders will be encouraged to support Balancer over the long-term instead of speculating short-term.\nPredictability\n: Fully automated BAL minting and \ninflation schedule locked forever.\nProtocol revenue distribution\n: 75% of all fees generated by the protocol are \nproportionally distributed to veBAL holders\n.\nPlug&play compatibility with Curve\u2019s ecosystem: \nit's expected that many protocols and products built on top of Curve's ve system will also launch on top of veBAL given the contracts have been kept the same.\nThis amazing new journey for Balancer Protocol requires action by both BAL holders and liquidity providers on Balancer (LP Token holders).\nVote Escrow is the mechanism of time locking tokens for a set period. The VE model aligns users\u2019 incentives and focuses on long-term Protocol performance. The belief is users who timelock tokens the longest believe in the Protocol the most and should have the greatest influence in the direction of the Protocol. \nIf you are new to this revolutionary tokenomics revamp, \nread our full recap here.\nLet's break down all you need to know.\nBAL holders\nWith the new ve system, just holding BAL does not give you any voting rights or any of the \nother benefits of the ve-system\n like liquidity mining boosting and Protocol revenue distribution.\nTo have these, you now need to \nhold veBAL\n, which you can get by locking LP Tokens (BPTs) of the \n80/20 BAL/WETH pool\n. We encourage \nadding liquidity proportionally (80% in BAL, 20% in WETH) to avoid price impact\n which means you'd get less BPTs than you could for the same value added.\nSee the below a visual explanation of the simple process:\nLearn how to stake your veBAL\nThe longest duration you can lock your LP Tokens (BPTs) for is \none year\n. The closer to one year you lock it up for, the more veBAL you get. As time goes by, voting power linearly decreases going to zero when your lockup end date comes.\nAt any time you can extend your lockup again for up to 1 year in the future which will again increase your veBAL balance.\nAn important reminder of an extra incentive:\nIn addition to 75% of protocol revenues, veBAL holders will also get 10% of all BAL minted weekly.\nDon't forget to vote for your favorite pool\nOnce you hold veBAL you can actively steer the distribution of BAL for liquidity mining by \nvoting on your favorite pools\n. The more veBAL a pool gets voted, the more BAL its LPs will receive from liquidity mining every week.\nBalancer Liquidity Providers\nOn Thursday, April 7th at 0:00 UTC the on-chain liquidity mining system will kick off for Ethereum Mainnet.\nFrom March 28, 2022 until April 7, 2022, Ethereum Mainnet Liquidity Providers on Balancer have to stake their LP Tokens (BPTs) to continue receiving liquidity mining incentives. \nIf you don't do so, you will not get any further BAL from April 7th onwards.\nRemember that you can also \nboost by up to 2.5x\n your liquidity mining APR by simply holding veBAL.\nPolygon and Arbitrum LPs will only have to stake their BPT in the near future, once the on-chain bridges have been set up. This will be widely communicated so hang on tight for now!\nClaiming BAL from On-chain Liquidity Mining\nAfter April 7th, if you have staked BPTs from pools that got voted by veBAL holders to get liquidity mining, you will be able to \neasily claim your BAL incentives\n at any time.\nEveryone in the Balancer Ecosystem is thrilled to see how far veBAL transforms Balancer Protocol. Special thank you to all of the developers and Balancer community members who worked so diligently to make this happen."
