Criminals haveincreasingly targeted them, with some $2 billion stolen in 13 different hacks, mostly this year, researcher Chainalysis said in August.The hackers stole around $100 million worth of crypto, Zhao said in his tweet. BNB Chain later saidin a blog post, opens new tabthat a total of 2 million of the BNB cryptocurrency - worth around $570 million - was withdrawn by the hacker.\nThe majority of the BNB remained in the hacker's digital wallet address, while about $100 million worth was \"unrecovered,\" the Binance spokesperson said by email.\nBNB Chain supports BNB, formerly known as Binance Coin, which is the world's fifth-largest token with a market value of over $45 billion, according to data site CoinGecko.Elliptic, a London-based crypto blockchain researcher, told Reuters that the hacker had minted 2 million new BNB tokens before transferring most of the funds to other cryptocurrencies including Tether and USD Coin.\nBNB Chain suspended its blockchain for several hours before resuming at around 0630 GMT, it said in a tweet.\nBNB Chain was \"able to stop the incident from spreading\" by contacting the blockchain's \"validators,\" - entities or individuals who verify blockchain transactions, it said in its blog post. There are 44 validators across several different time zones, it added without elaborating.\nBNB Chain, described by Binance as a \"community-driven, open-sourced and decentralized ecosystem,\" said it would introduce a new \"governance mechanism\" to counter future hacks, as well as expand the number of validators.\nIn March, hackers stole around $615 million from a blockchain bridge called Ronin Bridge, in one of the largest crypto heists on record, ter linked by the United States to North Korean hackers.The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.
