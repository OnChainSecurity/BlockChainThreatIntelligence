        "original_content": "Originally published\n by Schellman in October 2022. \nDid you know that we\u2019ve just come to the end of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month?\nWhen you think about it, October is a fitting choice for such a designation. After all, this is the time of year we\u2019re all watching scary movies about vampires, zombies, and\u2014if you\u2019ve got classic taste\u2014Michael Myers. \nFright of these fictional monsters is part of October\u2019s annual charm, but when it comes to your cybersecurity, the fear of breaches is decidedly not charming. \nIt\u2019s not a nice feeling to know there are actual malicious actors out there, lurking like Halloween ghouls, waiting to find a weakness in your applications, networks, or employees so they can take advantage, leaving you with financial and reputational losses.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll go over three of the prominent methods cybercriminals use to exploit organizations\u2014phishing, insider threats, and ransomware\u2014along with some basic mitigating tactics you can use against them.\nAs with haunted houses, the scariest things are what we don\u2019t know is out there, but having read this article, you\u2019ll be more on your toes and ready for the next jump scare.\n3 Cyber Threats You Need to Know About in 2022\nPhishing\nYou\u2019re likely already familiar with the concept of phishing attacks\u2014someone poses as a legitimate institution, often through website ads or e-mails, and dupes you into providing your personal information. \nShould anyone at your organization click on the wrong link at any given time, suddenly the \u201chorror movie\u201d has manifested itself and made you an example of the price paid for lax cybersecurity. \nCommon hallmarks of a phishing scam include:\nToo Perfect: \nAs in, the idea\u2014a cash prize or something similar\u2014is too good to be true. \n\u201cAct Fast!\u201d:\n Sometimes, cyber criminals will even threaten negative consequences if you don\u2019t provide personal details immediately, like shutting down your account. \nSubtle Hyperlink Deception:\n Bad actors will get sneaky with their URLs\u2014at a quick glance, you might read \nwww[.]bankofarnerica.com\n and see nothing wrong, but if you examine it closer, you\u2019ll see clicking it won\u2019t direct you to your bank.\nPhishing actually falls under the larger umbrella of social engineering, which encompasses more tactics that take advantage of unsuspecting people.\nInsider Threats\nThe human element to your cybersecurity is also particularly important when it comes to dealing with insider threats. Phishing may originate externally, \nbut \ninsider threats \ncome from within your organization\u2014think employees (current and former), vendors, or other stakeholders. They use their authorized access to do harm\u2014whether they\u2019re being deliberately malicious or unwittingly negligent.\nExamples of insider threats include:\nThose who exfiltrate data after being fired or furloughed\nThose who sell company data or trade secrets for profit\nLax third-party vendor security (which was responsible for the \ninfamous Target breach\n)\nThe point is that you not only have to worry about those who don\u2019t have access getting into places they shouldn\u2019t\u2014you also have to worry about those that do have access.\nRansomware\nFinally, we come to ransomware\u2014one of the most prevalent of cyberthreats at the minute. What was a popular buzzword has become extremely lucrative for cybercriminals. \nA type of malware, ransomware allows a hacker to encrypt a victim\u2019s file system and revoke the organization\u2019s access so that they can extract money in exchange for the data and/or restoration of access.\nThese criminals often use the following to get their exploitation malware onto your systems:\nPhishing\u2014mentioned above\nDrive-by downloading\u2014when a user unknowingly visits an infected website, at which point malware is downloaded and installed without their knowledge.\nPoor patch management \u2013 Internet-facing servers or services with unpatched vulnerabilities allowing remote code execution (RCE). When this type of issue is exploited, an attacker gains a foothold on your infrastructure, they can execute ransomware, or pivot deeper within the network.\nDon\u2019t just outsource: evaluate applicable information from your privacy and security policies and align the security training objectives with those of your organizational mission. \nMake sure this includes education, so your employees know how to spot phishing, pretexting, baiting, and other social engineering tactics \nThe better an organization\u2019s security training and awareness, the higher the number of reported incidents should be among its employees, and the smaller the risk of a breach.\nEngage a trusted third party to conduct realistic phishing simulations on a quarterly or more frequent basis \nNot only do you stand to potentially suffer an irreversible loss of your data, but the ransom numbers that must be paid aren\u2019t always small peanuts\n either\u2014\nthe highest known ransom payment\n to date was $40 million USD paid by CNA Financial in 2021.\nGiven that 2021 also showed \na 100% increase in the attacks themselves\n, it\u2019s long past time to start taking these threats seriously.\nHow to Mitigate Cyberthreats\nSo then, how to equip yourself with the right tools and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014informed employees in preparation to defend against these villains? \nTake Internal Action\nLet\u2019s break down these two facets we mentioned and provide some basic starting points:\n \n \n \nTier\n \n \n \nWhat You Should Do\n \n \n \n \n \nTools\n \n \n \nAt a baseline, do you have these in place?\n \nFirewalls\nIntrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS / IPS)\nAntivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software\n \nTo take it up a notch, have you implemented these?\n \nMulti-factor authentication (including \nFIDO2\n varieties, such as YubiKeys)\nPassword management tools (such as LastPass, \nKeePass\n, etc.)\nConsistent patching and security updates to computer software\n \n \n \n \n \nPeople\n \n \n \nInstill \na clean desk policy\n \nMandate adequate security training and awareness activities\n \nHow to know what\u2019s \u201cadequate?\u201d\nDon\u2019t just outsource: evaluate applicable information from your privacy\nand security policies and align the security training objectives with those of your\norganizational mission. \nMake sure this includes education, so your employees know how to spot\nphishing, pretexting, baiting, and other social engineering tactics\nThe better an organization\u2019s security training and awareness, the higher\nthe number of reported incidents should be among its employees, and the smaller\nthe risk of a breach.\nEngage a trusted third party to conduct realistic\nphishing simulations on a quarterly or more frequent basis \n \nHuman error remains one of the biggest threats against security, but your staff can also serve as the biggest assets here as well\u2014they just have to know what to look for while going about their work.\n \n \n \nFor more information on how to build a successful cybersecurity program across the board, \nread our article on the 5 cornerstones\n you need.\nLeverage Security and Compliance Assessments Against Cyberthreats\nMany organizations already have to comply with different industry standards such as NIST, PCI, ISO, and HIPAA\u2014adhering to those best practices within the frameworks will help tighten your security. \nYou also might consider \npenetration testing\n, \nof which there are different types that will simulate specific cyberattacks on your networks and applications to discover your vulnerabilities:\nNext Steps for Your Cybersecurity\nOctober may be National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, but the need for cyber defenses is year-round, \nespecially now as attacks continue to grow more and more sophisticated.\n \nAwareness is key\u2014for you and your staff\u2014and now you know about three big approaches hackers use.\nFor more tips on personal accountability and security, the \nNational Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS)\n is a great resource that offers good details on how individuals should be cognizant of internet use from both a personal and professional standpoint. \nYou might also check out our other content on other cybersecurity resources and threats so you can take all the necessary steps to protect yourself:"
