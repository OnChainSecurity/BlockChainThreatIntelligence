Learn more about the nexus of crypto, blockchain, and cyber defense.Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum - as well as blockchain technology more broadly - aim to provide secure digital money not controlled by governments or central banks.\n\nCryptocurrency's security relies on cryptography to protect it from unauthorized access. Cryptography can help ensure integrity in non-crypto applications that use blockchain technology and secure the computer systems that support both cryptocurrency and blockchains.\n\nThe role of cybersecurity in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has implications for society at large.\n\nThis page explores the interlocking relationship among cybersecurity, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\nCrypto began in 2009 as a reaction to the faltering of financial institutions. While widely discussed among techno wizards and entrepreneurs, many crypto users are low-income or unbanked.\n\nAs its name suggests, cryptocurrency - sometimes just called crypto - is an encrypted digital asset that serves as a monetary system. It allows users to complete an online transaction without using fiat money, or legal tender.\n\nCryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority like a bank or other company, which means the price can vary significantly from day to day.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency comes in many types, all work on the same principle of decentralization, and they all have to be mined before they can be used.\n\n\"Mining\" refers to the process in which computers solve computational equations that verify transactions and simultaneously add new blocks to the chain.Benefits and Risks of Crypto\nCrypto has the potential to reshape the financial world, but it is so complex that understanding or evaluating it is a struggle. Consider these benefits and risks:\n\nshield-check icon Fairer and More Democratic Financial System\nCrypto's creators envisioned a system that bypassed banks. Under a crypto-dominated financial approach, people would participate in the market with no third-party involvement.\n\nshield-check icon Hedge Against Inflation\nBitcoin, the primary cryptocurrency, features a finite number of coins. Under a bitcoin currency system, no government could flood the market with cheap money. In addition, using a global monetary system could help strengthen floundering national or regional economies.\n\nshield-exclamation icon Volatile and Non-scalable Investment\nAs a young industry, crypto has seen both dizzying highs and steep declines. Between April and June of 2022, for instance, Bitcoin's value dove from over $45,000 to $20,000.\n\nshield-exclamation icon Vulnerability and Security\nThe main risk with crypto is the potential for fraud or theft. In 2022 alone, cybercriminals pilfered more than $1 billion in cryptocurrency from wallets, exchanges, and other trading sites."
