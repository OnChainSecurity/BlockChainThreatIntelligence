        "original_content": "The dangerous flaws of Web3 security, according to a former hacker\nOctober 20, 2022\nBy Sue Poremba\n4 min read\nRisk Management\n\"New and improved\" is the refrain of progress, but new technology doesn\u2019t always turn out to be an improvement. In the case of the evolution from Web2 to Web3, a former hacker revealed how recent changes have created an all-new avenue of potential attack.\n\nRecent updates were intended to tighten security. \"Due to blockchain technology and its autonomous structure, it will also be safer than prior internet versions,\" explained the Spiceworks blog. \"Hackers will find it exceedingly tough to exploit the network, and even if they do, their activities will be logged.\"\n\nExcept, in this case, those \"improvements\" have created further concerns. The issue, for both consumers and businesses, is that the \"secure\" aspect of Web3 - the blockchain authentication of things like crypto wallets - can also pose a massive security problem.\n\nA former hacker reveals new avenues of attack\nMarcus Hutchins, a hacker-turned-security-pro, revealed new security weaknesses of Web3 in a social media video.\n\n\"Web3 has introduced a huge new attack surface,\" Hutchins said in the video.\n\nHackers now have access to a 51% attack, which is an attack on blockchain by groups who control more than 50% of the blockchain. Those groups who take over 51% or more of the blockchain have all the power to control the network.\n\nHutchens explains that smart contracts, which didn\u2019t exist in Web2, are another new issue. Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that will run when predetermined conditions are met, according to IBM. They are used to execute agreements without intermediaries and automate workflows. The smart contracts are getting hacked, creating a new attack surface.\n\nTo assume that new technology is secure just because it hasn\u2019t been hacked yet is a huge mistake, said Hutchins. All technology is susceptible to vulnerabilities and exploits and ignoring that just because something is branded as a more secure option opens up your organization and customers to untold risks.\n\nWhat exactly is Web3?\nTo understand Web3\u2019s security issues, we must understand what Web3 is. The term was first coined almost a decade ago by Gavin Wood, who developed one of the earliest and more successful cryptocurrencies, Ethereum. It is a decentralized technology, built on blockchain that allows users to have control over their own data and is meant to replace any internet interactions with traditional platforms.\n\nWeb3 aims to enhance the user experience by putting the user in charge of content. Without the need for a third-party platform to facilitate content, users will have control over their own data, improving privacy and giving them the choice of monetizing their personal information (rather than being sold and monetized by someone else). \n\nWeb3 fundamentally differs from Web2, explained Spiceworks. Web2 focuses on reading and writing content, while Web3 is about creating content while increasing trust. This trust is supposed to expand into better security and privacy, but the reality is less optimistic.\n\nExpanding the attack surface\nWhile blockchain hardens infrastructure against potential cyberattacks, it doesn\u2019t close the door to all types of risks, including some unique to Web3.\n\nExamining the potential of Web3 - and the potential nightmares - Forrester researched the new technology, determining that there are two primary issues with Web3. It\u2019s currently dominated by opportunists and investors in cryptocurrencies and various digital assets, particularly non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all operating within a largely unregulated environment. The second issue is that the core principles of Web3 simply aren\u2019t applicable in today\u2019s internet ecosystem.\n\n\"Web3 applications (including NFTs) aren\u2019t just vulnerable to attack, they often present a broader attack surface (due to the distributed nature of blockchains) than conventional applications do,\" Forrester reported.\n\nThe apps are prime targets for threat actors, Forrester added, because the tokens have a monetary value. They are prime targets for attack because the source code running on the blockchain is easily accessible. It\u2019s not protected by the type of security systems that protect an organization\u2019s infrastructure. Instead, all a hacker needs are good technical skills, and they are in.\n\n\"Source code is typically also easily available, as running closed source \u2018smart contracts\u2019 is frowned upon. The Web3 ethos is, after all, \u2018open code,'\" Martha Bennett, Forrester Vice President and Principal Analyst and a co-author of the report, told TechNewsWorld.\n\nBalancing user experience and security concerns\nDigital wallets will be the key to data privacy and security in a Web3 world. Just like a physical wallet holds everything a consumer needs - identification cards and various forms of currency - a digital wallet holds the same information, but with one big difference. The user gets to decide who supplies the contents of the wallet, such as the type of cryptocurrency or identifying credentials.\n\nBy putting control back in the hands of the user, organizations are expecting Web3 to improve overall consumer relations and develop loyalty between customer and brand. Decades of data breaches, identity theft and information misuse have taken their toll on consumer/corporate relations.\n\nHowever, there is a big difference between a physical wallet and a digital wallet. If the physical wallet goes missing, the owner might lose the cash but replace the credit cards, driver\u2019s license and other pieces of identification. That\u2019s not the case with a digital wallet, where all assets are gone for good if an attack accesses a wallet key. There is no fraud department in Web3 where a victim can report a theft. There\u2019s no FDIC to protect assets.\n\nThe bottom line is that cyber criminals are always looking for ways to make money. They will find ways to break into Web3 and all of blockchain\u2019s built-in security measures. Cryptocurrency is their preferred currency already, and with Web3, money is already part of the structure. And because there is no outside security system built around Web3 and its data, threat actors have added incentives to break the code.\n\nWeb3 is the future of computing, and as it is more widely adopted, it becomes a more attractive attack vector for cyber criminals. They will break in; they always find a way to thwart security. It\u2019s now up to organizations to recognize that Web3\u2019s security is not foolproof and that protecting data needs attention before it is too late."
