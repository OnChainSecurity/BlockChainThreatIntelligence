It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains.\n\n\nWith \nfiat currency\n there are many established ways for individuals and businesses to exchange money, creating a globally available and interoperable system of financial payments. Those systems include financial institutions, banks and credit cards that handle foreign exchange. In the world of blockchains, a cross-chain bridge serves an analogous purpose.\n\n\nExchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge, but it is expensive and more time-consuming. Without the use of a cross-chain bridge, users must first convert a cryptocurrency token into a fiat currency, which often involves fees. They then use currency to get the other desired type of cryptocurrency, incurring more fees and taking time.\n\n\nOne characteristic of a cross-chain bridge is that it enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without first changing it to fiat currency. Cross-chain bridges aren't limited to just cryptocurrency value transfer either. An effective cross-chain bridge can also enable the transfer of \nsmart contracts\n and NFTs from one blockchain environment to another.\n\n\nThere are several approaches to enabling transfers with a cross-chain bridge. One common approach is using a wrapped token issued by the cross-chain bridge provider platform. With a wrapped token, the value of one token from a specific blockchain network can be encapsulated inside another token. Wrapped tokens are typically based on the ERC-20 technical specification for an Ethereum network. For example, WBTC is a Bitcoin token wrapped with an ERC-20 Ethereum smart contract.\n\n\nAnother approach to enabling cross-chain bridge transfers is by using a liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, a cross-chain bridge provider holds inventory -- or pools -- of various coins where one can be exchanged for another.\n\n\nCross-chain bridges can also be a lucrative target for hackers. One of the largest attacks occurred in February 2022, when cross-chain bridge platform \nWormhole was the victim of an attack\n in which the threat actor stole 120,000 wrapped Ethereum tokens -- worth an estimated $320 million at the time of the theft. BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain, was the victim of an attack in October 2022 that resulted in losses \nestimated at $570 million\n. Blockchain bridge analysis vendor \nChainalyis \nhas estimated that 69% of cryptocurrency funds stolen in 2022 have been attributed to attacks on cross-chain bridges.\n\n\nLearn more about how \ncryptocurrency cyber attacks are on the rise\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest cross-chain bridges\n\n\nFor \nBitcoin\n, which is perhaps the most well-known cryptocurrency, the most common bridge is with the use of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Wrapped Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as a blockchain bridge, as it enables Bitcoin as an ERC-20 token -- a token specification that is supported on many other blockchains.\n\n\nWhile Bitcoin is well known, the Bitcoin blockchain doesn't have the same smart contract features that are the foundation of \nEthereum\n-based blockchains. Smart contracts enable decentralized finance, decentralized apps and NFTs. Users looking to use Bitcoin across other blockchain networks will first need to covert to Wrapped Bitcoin. This was originally run as a blockchain bridge by BitGo, and in 2022 is supported and available via a growing partner network of exchanges.\n\n\nCross-chain bridge providers often support \nmultiple types of blockchains\n, though specific support varies from provider to provider. Support for bringing smart contracts, tokens and NFTs from the Ethereum mainline to different blockchain networks is among the most common feature across cross-chain bridges.\n\n\nWhen choosing a cross-chain bridge, users should be sure the specific blockchain network -- as well as token or NFT -- they are looking to bridge is supported. Different networks also have varying fees, which can be volatile and change quickly.\n\n\nHere are some popular cross-chain bridges:\n\n\nCeler cBridge\n\n\nThe Celer cBridge uses the Celer State Guardian Network to enable liquidity across different blockchains.\n\n\nSupported blockchain networks:\n Ethereum, Astar Network, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Metis Mainnet, Oasis Emerald, Celo, Aurora, Harmony, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Optimism, Boba Network, OKExChain, Heco, Clover, Gnosis Chain, Milkomeda Cardano and Shiden.\n\n\nSupported cryptocurrency tokens:\n Tether, USD Coin, Ethereum, MetisDAO, Kromatika, Binance USD, Thales, Domi Coin, Dodo, Unified Society, Lyra, JPEGvault, Immutable X, dForce, xToken, Wootrade, Perpetual Protocol, Mask Network, Izumi Finance, MCDex, PolkaEx, CEC Energy Chain, PerlinX, Reef Chain, Boba Network and Standard Protocol.\n\n\nWebsite:\n \nhttps://cbridge.celer.network\n\n\nCross-Chain Bridge\n\n\nThis platform was developed by the Germany-based Tixl organization, which rebranded as the Autobahn Network in March 2022.
